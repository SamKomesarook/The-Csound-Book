Its far from being an exhaustive approach of all possible applications of neural algorithms to sound synthesis, and sadly the results are not that much convincing. But some ground is covered, and some tools offered, although this routines may not be appropriate for the fainthearted.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">This aint exactly a tutorial on neural networks (so dont expect me to be nitpicking with the details). We'll be focusing primarily on the neural algorithms implementation, and keep theoretical explanations to a minimum. I am not by the slightest chance an expert on neural nets, and some of the stuff I say here may be plain wrong. Hopefully after reading this you will have a better understanding of how a neural network actually does whatever it does, and will have learned how to implement some of the classic algorithms, like hebbian learning and back-propagation.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">I just started this line of instruments, and feel like I'm merely scratching the surface. I've had trouble enough debugging the routines, to make sure the neural processing actually works, in order to take full advantage of the Csound synthesis power just yet. I keep trying to discover the most effective network models to work with sound, as well as the best audio encoding procedures to use, building my, still rather limited, knowledge of sound synthesis on the way.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the code is fully debugged and optimized, we can start thinking of other sound applications, in which neural nets can prove useful. But just so that I, and you, can contemplate more advanced uses in the sound synthesis field, we need to assert exactly how far can we go, and at what expense. That will be this paper's main goal.<br>		&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>		<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times"><b>Why Csound?</b></font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">My interests concern a great deal more than artificial intelligence. One of the most important is obviously music, along with everything else that relates to it. I've studied music theory, improvisation, rhythm, and then, more recently, sound synthesis and processing, which then lead me to Csound. Quite naturally, it gave me the same passionate feelings I had towards A.I., maybe because of its complex structure, yet inner simplicity, maybe because of its huge potential, and more or less esoteric codings, that render it a virtually endless challenge (the best kind :)).</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">So, why not bring these two passions together?</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">Well, unfortunately, this is not that straight forward. There are many adversities to fight against, when porting the massive neural processing routines to a Csound environment.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">Granted, it may not be the best computational environment for neural algorithms, but that should not prevent us form experimenting with it. I think new ways of pushing the boundaries of Csound are never too much, so why not give it a try? As we'll see, we'll have to adapt to Csound idiosyncrasy, and the sonic domain properties, as well as to the neural algorithms characteristics and computational limitations, in order to get something tangible.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">The usefulness of these programs, and their applications in digital sound processing?, well, you tell me, if you find any :)<br>		</font><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;		<hr>		</font></p>		<dir><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Next : </b><a href="intro.html">Introduction to neural networks</a></font>			<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Up:</b> <a href="index.html">Back to index</a></font>		</dir>	</body></html>
