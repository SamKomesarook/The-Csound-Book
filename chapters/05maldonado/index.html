<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. Using Real-time Csound MIDI
with Windows</FONT></H1>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Gabriel Maldonado</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This proposal concerns the well-known
sound-synthesis language Csound. Some additions have been made
in order to use Csound in real-time. These additions allow a live
control of the synthesis process with the Windows operating system.
The aim is to give the user a powerful and low-cost workstation
to produce new sounds and new music interactively and also to
make live performances. Try to imagine Csound being a universal
musical instrument.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Why Real-Time?</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Csound is one of the most famous
sound-synthesis languages. At the beginning of the &#145;90s its
author, Berry Vercoe, has added some MIDI oriented opcodes to
use it in real-time. At that time the only machines capable to
run Csound in real-time, were the Silicon Graphics and some other
expensive UNIX workstations. Some years later the Intel-based
PCs became fast enough to run Csound in real-time, but at first
they were capable to accomplish this task only under the LINUX
OS, and without any MIDI support. DOS and Windows were rigorously
kept off the real-time dream.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now low-latency AUDIO support,
MIDI support and many MIDI opcodes have been implemented under
Windows, to allow the user to control Csound as it could be a
sort of musical instrument.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the difference in using
Csound in real-time rather than using it in deferred-time? For
what reason should a composer prefer to use it in real-time? The
more trivial reason is that running Csound redirecting its output
to the audio-DACs (instead of writing the output on a file) saves
both space on the hard-disk and time to listen to the result;
it can be quite useful when composing a piece, because normally
a lot of tests are necessary to achieve the composer expectations.
In this case real-time is not essential, it is only more convenient.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But there are cases in which real-time
is indispensable. What about if a composer decides to make a piece
in which some musical parameters are fixed, but other ones are
modifiable during the performance? And if he wants to control
a MIDI synthesiser by means of his favourite Csound algorithm
or pitch tables? And if a performer needs a synthesiser capable
of completely new synthesis methods, which aren&#146;t implemented
in any hardware synths yet? Real-time becomes also necessary when
some non-intuitive parameters of the composition need to be defined
accurately by means of the composer&#146;s ears.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Initialisation Parameters and
Continuous Parameters from the Real-Time Point of View</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Csound there are three kinds
of signals:<B><I> i-rate</I></B> (initialisation stage variables),
<B><I>k-rate</I></B> (control rate variables) and <B><I>a-rate</I></B>
(audio rate variables) signals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The<I> k-rate</I> and<B><I> </I></B><I>a-rate</I>
signals can be considered <I>continuous</I> from the user point
of view. This means that these two kinds of signals can be thought
as slanting-straight lines or curves (Fig.1 a,b,c).<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/fig1.gif" HEIGHT="300"
WIDTH="421" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The<I> k-rate</I> signals are
normally used to control the behaviour of a generator unit or
a modifier unit. Sometimes it is recommended to use <I>a-rate</I>
for control signals too, for example when the amplitude envelope
of an audio generator has got fast transients, or when an LFO
must control a flanger delay. In these cases audible distortion
occurs if <I>k-rate</I> is used, so it is necessary to use <I>a-rate</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the other hand, <I>i-rate</I>
values cannot be considered exactly as signals. In fact they remain
constant for the entire duration of a Csound note event. If one
imagined them in a graph, he could think them as a stepped picture
(Fig.2). Each step refers to an<I> i-statement</I> of Csound score
or to a note-on MIDI message recognised by the MIDI IN port.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/fig2.gif" HEIGHT="383"
WIDTH="526" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Further, <I>i-rate</I>, <I>k-rate</I>
and <I>a-rate</I> signals can be considered in two different ways
from Csound instruments point of view:</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">internally-generated<BR>
</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">externally-received<BR>
</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For example, Csound score <I>p-fields</I>
are <I>externally-received</I> <I>i-rate</I> values, because they
are not defined inside the instrument block, but externally, in
the score. Global <I>k-rate</I> and <I>a-rate</I> signals are
<I>internally-generated</I> by an instrument, but they can be
considered as <I>externally-received</I> from the target-instruments
point of view. Obviously incoming MIDI control-change messages
are <I>externally-received</I> signals. Signals sent to the MIDI
OUT port are <I>internally-generated</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Externally-received</FONT></I><FONT
 FACE="Times New Roman"> <I>k-rate</I> signals will be named <B><I>continuous
parameters</I></B>, and <I>externally-received i-rate</I> values
<B><I>init parameters</I></B>. <I>a-rate</I> signals will not
be taken into account, because normally they are not used as real-time
control signals, but they are as audio signals. So it is possible
to draw a table:<BR>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">SA and MA Instruments</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A running instance of a Csound-orchestra&#146;s
instrument can be activated in two ways: by the score and by a
MIDI note-on message. So there are two kinds of instruments:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">SA Instruments</FONT></B><FONT
 FACE="Times New Roman"> (Score Activated instruments)</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">MA Instruments</FONT></B><FONT
 FACE="Times New Roman"> (MIDI Activated instruments)</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">MA</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
and <I>SA</I> instruments can coexist in the same Csound orchestra.
If an orchestra contains only <I>MA</I> instruments, and function
tables are not used (for example when using the &#145;<I>pluck&#146;</I>
opcode to produce the sound), a Csound score could be an almost
empty file. In that case, the only statement which must be present
in the score is the <B><I>f0 </I></B>statement, followed by the
action time (which must be equal to the total duration of the
performance). This statement is required to avoid a zero-seconds
duration of the real-time session.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">MA</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">instruments can contain
the following Csound opcodes (whereas <B><I>SA</I> </B>instruments
cannot):</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">notnum, veloc, cpsmidi, cpsmidib,
cpsmidib, octmidi, octmidib, octmidib, pchmidi, pchmidib, pchmidib,
ampmidi, aftouch, chpress, pchbend, midictrl, midictrl, midictrlsc,
imidic7, midic7, imidic14, midic14, imidic21, midic21</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Notice that none of these opcode
contains MIDI channel as an argument. If one of these opcodes
is included into an <I>SA</I> instrument, unpredictable errors
could occur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In most cases the midi-channel
number of a note-on or control-change message is the same as the
instr number to be activated, however they can be reassigned by
means of the <B><I>massign</I></B> opcode. If <I>massign</I> is
not used, <I>MA</I> instruments must be numbered 1 to 16.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As in the following MIDI-oriented
opcodes an input argument with MIDI channel information is present,
they can be used in <B><I>SA</I> </B>instruments:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ictrl7, ctrl7, ictrl14, ctrl14,
ictrl21, ctrl21, chanctrl, chanctrl, initc7, initc14, initc21,
slider8, slider16, slider8f, slider16f, islider8, islider16.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">SA</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
and <I>MA</I> instruments can cooperate in the same orchestra.
For example, an <I>SA</I> instrument can contain several instances
of &#145;<I>ctrl7&#146;</I> opcode, each one defining a different
<I>continuous-parameter. </I>Each parameter is stored in a global
variable. So the corresponding <I>continuous-parameter</I> is
shared by all the instances of the <I>MA</I> instrument. It is
a sort of sending/receiving process inside the same Csound orchestra:
performer actions are received by the MIDI-IN port; an <I>SA</I>
instrument containing some midi opcodes transforms these messages
in global variables; these global variables (which are the actual
<I>continuous-parameters</I>) are read by an <I>MA</I> instrument.
In this case, the <I>SA-</I>instrument-instance&#146;s life begins
at the start of Csound and lasts all the duration of the real-time
session, whereas <I>MA-</I>instrument-instances&#146;s action-times
and durations depend on the performer&#146;s actions.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Four Different Ways to Use Csound
in Real-Time</FONT></h3></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first way can be considered
as the most trivial one. A normal orchestra contains only <I>SA</I>
instruments and no parameters are modified during the performance,
because all the informations are contained in the orchestra/score
pair. No MIDI opcodes are used in this case, and sound output
is identical to that of the wave-file produced by running a deferred-time
Csound session with the same orchestra/score pair. This way can
be useful to reduce the waiting time of wave-file processing and
to eliminate the necessity of a big hard-disk storage space, but
in every respect this method is identical to deferred-time by
the hearing point of view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second way is the opposite
to the first. According to this way, it is possible to consider
Csound a MIDI synthesiser (the most powerful synth in the world!).
This synth can be connected to a MIDI master-keyboard for a piano-like
performance; furthermore it is possible to play Csound with controllers
different from a piano keyboard, such as wind controllers, guitar
controllers, drum controllers etc. In this case no <I>p-fields</I>
are present in the score. All the <I>init</I> and <I>continuous
parameters</I> are received via MIDI. Each note is activated by
a MIDI note-on message and deactivated by a note-off message.
So <I>init parameters</I> are defined by the informations contained
in a note-on message: the orchestra instrument number is selected
by the MIDI channel, the MIDI note-number and the velocity can
be used to set two additional <I>init parameters </I>(this task
can be accomplished by using the <I>notnum, cpsmidi, octmidi,
pchmidi, veloc </I>and<I> ampmidi </I>opcodes)<I>. </I>Other <I>init
parameters</I> can be set by sampling and holding the current
status of Csound controller array at the instr initialisation
stage (this task can be accomplished by using <I>imidic7, imidic14,
imidic21, ictrl7, ictrl14, ictrl21, islider8, islider16, islider32,
islider64, is16b14 </I>and<I> is32b14</I> opcodes in an <I>MA</I>
instrument). It is suggested to use a MIDI mixer or the VMCI program
(see below for more informations on it) to control a controllers
bank. It is possible to use VMCI as a synth-editor for Csound
by designing an instrument with a big number of init-rate controller
opcodes, each one defining a particular patch-parameter. For example,
the amplitude envelope ADSR durations and levels of an instrument
can be assigned to a bank of sliders. So a Csound instrument can
be considered as the type of synth-algorithm used, in which each
slider configuration (when using VMCI this configuration can be
saved on disk) becomes the particular synth-patch that can be
edited according to user taste. Continuous parameters can be modified
via MIDI by gestural actions of the performer by means of devices
such as control-sliders, modulation-wheels, breath-controls, pitch-wheels,
aftertouch etc. (the opcodes implemented to accomplish these tasks
are: <I>aftouch, chpress, pchbend, midictrl, midictrlsc, midic7,
midic14, midic21, ctrl7, ctrl14, ctrl21, slider8, slider16, slider32,
slider64, slider8f, slider16f, slider32f, slider64f, s16b14 </I>and<I>
s32b14)</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The third way to use Csound in
real-time is joining SA instruments to some parameters which are
modifiable in real-time by a MIDI controller during the score
performance. In this case each note has its p-fields already defined
in the score, but there can be some additional <I>init</I> or
<I>continuous parameters</I> that can be modified at performance
time. The action-time and the duration of each note are fixed,
but the metronomic speed of the performance can be changed in
real-time by the user. Any kind of parameter can be assigned to
a live controller. This can enrich the concert performances: each
time the composition will acquire a new flavour, it will never
be exactly the same.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The fourth way to use Csound reminds
us a little the old and cheap Casio keyboards &quot;<I>one-key-play</I>&quot;
mode. In this mode, note-on messages are used to trigger the note-events,
that are pulled out from a queue of note-parameter blocks stored
into a table, i.e. all the <I>init-parameters</I> of each note
have to be stored into a table. Note-off messages are used to
deactivate a playing note. Overlapping notes, as well as polyphony
are allowed. All the init parameters used in a conventional <I>SA</I>
instrument can be ported to a real-time activated instrument (<I>MA</I>
instrument) when using this method. I like to play Csound in this
way very much, because it is possible to define a lot of very
precise parameters for each note, but the activation time and
the duration of each note is decided by the performer at performance
time. This enables the user to control all these interpretative
nuances of time such as <I>ritardando</I> and <I>accelerando</I>,
very difficult to define with precision at the score-design time.
Also, two additional init-values can be used to control any kind
of parameter; these values are obtained by the note-number and
the velocity of each note played at performance time. A section
of an <I>SA</I> instrument of a standard score can be easily converted
to be used with the &quot;<I>one-key-play</I>&quot; mode. The
new GEN 23 function-table generator subroutine, which reads numeric
values from an external ASCII file, can be used to do this job.</FONT></P>
