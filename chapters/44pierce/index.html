<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am currently employed as Senior
Music Technician at <A HREF="http://www.Bathspa.ac.uk/">Bath Spa
University College.</A>&nbsp; My main interest is in computer
music, particularly the use of Csound.&nbsp; When I was asked
to contribute a piece, I wanted to produce a work that had something
in common with a track from my lastest CD&nbsp; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
 FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">&quot;BEATSYSTEM 2297 &quot;</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Times New Roman">, released September 1997 on EM:T Records.
The result is a piece that uses the same source material and similar
processes to the similarly named track on the CD. I am particularly
interested in the possibilities of granular synthesis - I like
the fluid textures it can produce, and the variety of ways in
which it can be implemented.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Composition</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The composition &quot;Invade
areas where nothing's definite&quot; uses three different opcodes
in csound all of which read the same source file -&nbsp; John
Cage speaking the words of the title. The first one I have called
a&nbsp; <A HREF="DynPitch.orc">&quot; Dynamic pitch shift instrument&quot;</A>.
This reads a table containing <A HREF="cage.wav">&quot;cage.wav&quot;</A>
at varying speed, producing a lowering of pitch over time. The
score for this instrument was generated using the program &quot;CMASK&quot;;
this produced the constant grainsize but variable-pitch score
that was needed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;The second instrument, a
<A HREF="DynGran.orc">&quot; Dynamic Granulation instrument&quot;
</A>, uses the <A HREF="granule.html">granule</A> opcode to produce
a granular synthesis texture in which both the gap between the
grains and their length vary over time - i.e. the gaps get shorter
and so do the lengths. These grains are extracted from the source
file, moving only in a forward direction, and written to the new
lengthened output. Their length is shortened from .3msec to .002msec
over the duration set in p3, i.e. 174 seconds. The gaps between
these grains reduce from .2msec to .002msec, again during time
p3. A small offset is added so that both channels are slightly
different, giving an enhanced stereo image from two mono outputs.<BR>
Whilst all this takes place another instrument,&nbsp;<A HREF="SndWarp.orc">
&quot; Soundwarp instrument&quot;</A>, based on Richard Karpen's
<A HREF="sndwarp.html">sndwarp</A> opcode, is busy stretching
the 3 second source to 180 seconds. This instrument is copied
and the outputs placed in the left and right channels of the final
piece. One channel stretches the original slightly less than the
other, giving a phasing effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The combined effect of these three
instruments is, I believe, very interesting. There seem to be
artifacts produced that enhance the overall perception of the
piece. I believe that learning to use Csound is well worth the
effort involved as it gives the composer a unique palette with
which to construct wonderful soundscapes.<BR>
