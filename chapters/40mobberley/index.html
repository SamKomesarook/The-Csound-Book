<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">38. The Csound SuperSampler/Sequencer</FONT></H1>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Dr. James Mobberley</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Like many composers, I came
to Csound directly from work with digital synthesizers, samplers,
and sequencers. I also, like many composers, saw immediately that
there were many advantages to csound over these separate units.
First, everything was in one box. Second, and more important,
every single note event in csound could be sculpted individually
with great precision. Unlike standard sequencers, each csound
&quot;note&quot; could have its own individual envelope, pitch
contour, timbre, spatial placement, reverberance, and duration.
Most of these parameters are definable in standard sequencers
but some are seriously restricted. For example, though each sound
can have its own duration, all notes of a given voice will have
the same, envelope, basic timbre, and lfo-defined pitch shape.
For many purposes, sequencers which allow for 16 polyphonic voices
are quite sufficient. But composers who might, for example, want
to take fifty piano attacks of .2 seconds each, and string them
together in a one-second collage, giving each a variety of glissando
shapes and giving each a gradually sharpening attack would find
themselves out of luck.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Much of my writing in the 1980s
combined a solo live instrument with pre-recorded tape, and I
had specialized in the use of the sounds of the solo instrument
in making the tape part &#151; creating a built-in timbral unity
between soloist and tape. In 1992 I was commissioned by pianist
Barry Hannigan to write a short work for piano and tape. By then
I had had some experience with Csound, and I wanted to create
this work using Csound to manipulate piano samples which I stored
on our studio&#146;s NeXT machine. I had used samples before with
Csound, but only through the soundin unit generator, which does
not allow pitch shifting of the samples. I was particularly interested
in creating a &quot;glissando-ing piano&quot;, since such things
do not occur in nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In fact, what resulted was a Csound
&quot;Super Sampler/Sequencer&quot;. The orchestra allows the
user to select pre-recorded individual mono soundfiles, choose
a beginning and ending pitch level for each sound (automatically
adjusting the resulting duration), set a volume level, select
from a collection of user-defined envelopes, reverse the sound
if desired, and set a simple panning shape for the sound in the
stereo field of the output file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The basic orchestra, which I called
&quot;sampenv&quot;, spent most of its time applying pitch shapes
and envelopes to soundfiles, using genroutine 01 to read the samples
from an existing soundfile into a table. The envelope creation
and application takes a lot of space in the orchestra, but is
exceptionally straightforward. I&#146;ll begin the discussion
with the pitch shaping, which is quite compact but requires some
more extensive explanation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once they have been stored in
a table, the samples from the soundfile can be read forward or
backward, and at constant or varying speed. If the speed of the
&quot;tableread&quot; is the same as the original file, then there
is no pitch change. If it is faster, the pitch will be higher
(and the duration shorter); if slower, the pitch will be lower
(and the duration longer). If the speed changes over the course
of the resulting note, then the sound will glissando from the
start speed to the end speed. It works exactly like a tape deck,
though the amount of control is exceptionally precise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The challenge was to set up the
math in the orchestra such that the values in score p-fields could
be as musically intuitive as possible, yet produce predictable
results. My solution was to set up three p-fields. The first controls
the initial pitch of the resulting soundfile, the second defines
the number of divisions of the octave, and the last controls the
final pitch of the file. Examples:</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Translation of p4 p5 p6</FONT></H2>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">0 any# 0</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">-8 1 8</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
- using one-note-per-octave equal temperament, start 8 octaves

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This apparatus does not allow
for pitch shapes more sophisticated than simple unidirectional
glissandi, but notes can be grouped in succession in the scorefile
to create all sorts of shapes. NOTE: the mathematical conversions
that determine the duration of the resulting pitch-shifted soundfile
were provided by James Beauchamp of the University of Illinois.
An understanding of the math is not necessary for the use of this
orchestra.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The next section of the orchestra
applies volume and envelope shapes to the pitch-shifted soundfile.
Since recorded soundfiles are often of widely varying dynamic
level, the process of reading the samples into the table automatically
normalizes the amplitude levels from zero (softest) to one (loudest).
With our NeXT workstation, the maximum amplitude capacity of the
resulting soundfile output is 32767, so I selected a basic working
amplitude multiplier of 3000, meaning that if I do not alter the
amplitude of a note, it will have a maximum amplitude of 3000.
I then set up p7 as a volume multiplier, with &quot;1&quot; being
unity and other numbers increasing or decreasing the maximum amplitude
of the note. For example:</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Translation of p7</FONT></H2>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
- maxamps for this note will be 3000</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">.5</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
- maxamps for this note will be 1500</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
- maxamps for this note will be 12,000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It might seem logical to assume
that if each note of an eleven-note &quot;chord&quot; is given
a multiplier of one, the resulting soundfile will have a maxamp
value of 33,000, which exceeds the amplitude capacity of the system,
but in fact the maxamp points of each of the component notes rarely
coincide. It would be more reasonable to expect that an eleven-note
chord might top out at 12,000 - 20,000 maxamps. I have found 3000
to be a very reasonable working figure that rarely produces amplitudes
in excess of 32767. Composers should experiment with various multipliers
depending on their particular needs and systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Once a basic volume level is set,
the orchestra allows any number of envelope shapes to be constructed.
I have created seven, each of which begins and ends at zero to
avoid clicks. P8 controls which envelope is selected:</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Translation of p8</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Other, more complicated envelopes
can be created in an orchestra, or these seven simple envelopes
can be applied to consecutive notes in a score to simulate more
complicated single-note envelopes. I have had significant success
creating complicated textures by amassing a large number of notes,
each of which has a hairpin envelope. Also, by overlapping hairpins
consecutively, one can simulate a much longer note than a single
stored sample would permit. For example, a single 4&quot; sample
can be used with a hairpin envelope. At time = 2&quot;, when the
maximum point of the hairpin is reached, a second identical note
can begin, also with a hairpin. By adding additional notes, each
starting two seconds later than the last, the note can be sustained
indefinitely at the same basic volume level. The result will have
a &quot;phased&quot; sound, and will have a noticeable repetitive
quality with a two-second &quot;period&quot;, but will be less
choppy than most sample loops. Multiple versions of these &quot;extended
notes&quot; can be used, which will further obscure any sense
of predictable repetition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Next, the user chooses whether
to keep the original sample order or to reverse the order, which
will cause the soundfile to be heard backwards. I have used p11
for this, and set up a conditional that selects reverse order
only if the p11 value is &quot;-1&quot;. Any other value produces
a forward read.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, as the mono sound is
sent to the outputs, the orchestra pans the sound to a particular
location in the stereo field of the 2-channel output. The simplest
way to do this is to reduce the amplitude of the sound by one
percentage in the first (left) output, and by its complement in
the second (right) output. For example, sending the sound out
at 25% amplitude in the left channel and 75% in the right creates
a stereo placement of halfway between center and right. Similarly,
50% and 50% creates a center pan, while 0% and 100% creates a
total right-speaker pan. For this orchestra, I am using a slightly
more sophisticated, but still simple panning procedure that allows
not only single-point placement but also a linear movement of
each sound from one point to another during the duration of the
sound. By creating a 3-variable linseg whose first (p9) and last
(p10) values are numbers between 0 and 1, and whose middle value
is p3, a simple multiplication of this linseg to the left channel
(kpan) and its inverse to the right channel (1-kpan) will produce
a linear pan-shift that can be unique for each sound. For example:</FONT></P>
