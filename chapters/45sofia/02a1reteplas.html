It is based on a Latin text from the Vulgate Bible: Psalm 39:12-13, Psalm 40:1-3, and Psalm 150 of the King James Version.<br>		<br>		The intent was to translate the Latin words of the text and to generate a melodic sequence by dividing the octave into 26 microtones, one for each letter in the alphabet. It was also intended that the composition be performed with a computer and not with acoustic instruments because of the microtonality application. This provided flexibility for experimenting with complex rhythms and tempo application. The main tool used to compose <i>Reteplas</i> was Csound, a computer synthesis parameter-oriented program, which allows music elements to be specified mathematically. This wider scope of choice in musical ingredients was the main motivation in composing for a computer, rather than to simulate live musicians, and <i>Reteplas</i> was intended as a vehicle in which to explore this flexibility.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">		<hr>		</font></p>		<p><a href="01.html"><font face="Times New Roman">Up One Level</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><br>		</font></p>		<p><a href="index.html"><font face="Times New Roman">Back to Document Index</font></a></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">		<hr>		</font>	</body></html>
