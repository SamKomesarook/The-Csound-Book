The latter are not too high or too low in frequency ratio to be called augmented or diminished. In order to remain as close as possible to the traditional names when it came to microtone intervals, the &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot; categories were adopted.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">The interval results were placed in their respective tables as shown in the following Examples 8-10, which state the Primary and Secondary interval categories, and their individual occurrences.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">Example 8 shows the total of 20 Primary intervals: 8 perfect consonances, 7 imperfect consonances, and 5 dissonances. Even though these intervals were composed in microtonality there were more intervals belonging to the Primary category than there were in the Secondary category.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Example 8:</b> Primary intervals' table.</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="figures/c1reteplas_b.gif" alt="[Picture c1Reteplas]"><br>		</font></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman">		<hr>		</font></p>		<p><a href="12.html"><font face="Times New Roman">Up One Level</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"><br>		</font></p>		<p><a href="index.html"><font face="Times New Roman">Back to Document Index</font></a></p>		<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em></em>		<hr>		</font>	</body></html>
