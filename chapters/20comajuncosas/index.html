<H1>19. Analog Dreams: Modeling Commercial Synthesizers<BR>
</H1>

<P>Csound works fine for analog synthesis! Here&acute;s a set
of instruments useful to emulate your beloved old analog synths.
At the end I&acute;ve included my own Roland bassline TB-303 emulator
to see some of them in practice.</P>

<H3>The Oscillators</H3>

</h3>

<P><I>Aliasing free band-limited analog waveforms</I> (to be used
as audio signals)</P>

<P><A HREF="instruments/square.zip">Square wave</A><BR>
<A HREF="instruments/saw.zip">Sawtooth wave</A><BR>
<A HREF="instruments/pwm.zip">PWM (pulse width modulation)</A><BR>
<A HREF="instruments/triangle.zip">Triangle wave</A><BR>
<A HREF="instruments/rampsaw.zip">Ramp/saw modulation</A></P>

<P><I>Geometrically generated analog waveforms</I> (to be used
as control signals, e.g. LFO&acute;s etc.)</P>

<P><A HREF="instruments/lfo1.zip">Square wave / Sawtooth wave
/ Triangle wave</A> : the static waveform is stored in a table.<BR>
<A HREF="instruments/lfo2.zip">PWM (pulse width modulation) /
Ramp/saw modulation</A> : for those instruments the duty cicle
is updated every cycle.</P>

<P>Note: use te subaudio generators with care. Those with discontinuities
(square, saw, PWM) cause clicks in the example. At lower frequencies,
modulating other timbral parameters and even applying a k-rate
filter to them can greatly reduce this effect.</P>

<H3>The Filters</H3>

</h3>

<P><A HREF="instruments/combs1.zip"><I>Comb filters</I></A></P>

<P>IIR &amp; FIR comb filters implemented at low level, to add
some character to the sound. Very interesting if used with a broadband
signal, like white noise. Yous can tune them to a fairly high
frequency for resonance like effects, or to the fundamental frequency
of the expected timbre in white noise.</P>

<P><A HREF="instruments/combs2.zip"><I>Special&nbsp; filters</I></A></P>

<P>A 24 dB filter plus a reson at fco, a comb filter with a reson
in the feedback loop (a sort of resonant filter), and a low pass-comb
filter.</P>

<P><A HREF="instruments/rezon.zip"><I>That Resonant Lowpass filter...</I></A></P>

<P>The classical 24 dB low pass filter with resonance.There are
some other notable designs around there, particularly those from
Hans Mikelson. This one sounds quite well and can even self-oscillate
to give funny <I>acid</I> efects. For the perfeccionist use a
fairly high sample rate (say 96000 Hz) and then downsample with
a good anti-alias filter, like that included in Sound Forge 4.
Here&acute;s a sample of what you can do with it, filtering a
bandlimited pulse wave (generated with <I>buzz</I>) and applying
the same envelope to the resonance and the filter cutoff frequency
(it sounds much better without that mp3 compression): <A HREF="audio/rezon.mp3">rezon.mp3</A></P>

<H3><A HREF="instruments/tb303.zip">Roland TB 303 Emulator</A></H3>

<P>The same controls as the real thing, given the initial and
final settings as p-fields in the score. The patterns are stored
in tables also chosen in the score, so you only have to trigger
the instrument and the sequencer works alone. The code is full
of comments so you should be able to understand it.<BR>
