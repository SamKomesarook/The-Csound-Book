Rules&quot; for Designing Auditory Displays</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Information sizzles
and rustles, it can whooosh or splash, or rumble. You can hear
information in the natural environment, but can you hear information
in digital data? The soundtracks of computer games demonstrate
that synthetic sounds can provide information that may be difficult
to see, and that sounds may enhance enjoyment and performance
in an activity. However game design is not driven by issues of
faithful representation that are primary for the designer of an
auditory display of data structure. The design of sounds to support
information processing activities is a new challenge because of
the types of information involved, and the need for a consistent
understanding by a cross-section of people. This chapter introduces
some principles for designing auditory information that address
these challenges. These principles are demonstrated by individual
examples, and then applied as a whole to the design of an auditory
display that can allow a listener to quickly answer the question
&quot;is there gold in this pile of dirt?&quot;</FONT></P>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Yes, people can
hear information about data that is mapped into sounds. This conclusion
is based on the results of a series of formal experiments carried
out by Sarah Bly in the early 1980&#146;s. In one of her experiments
she asked participants to sort gold from dirt by listening to
a six dimensional mapping of soil measurements into sounds. Most
listeners were able to correctly identify more than half the samples.
However the ability to hear this information depends critically
upon how the data is mapped into sound. The lack of a systematic
approach to designing the data-to-sound mapping was identified
by Bly as a &quot;gaping hole&quot; impeding progress in auditory
display [Bly S. 1994]. Perhaps we can look to methods of graphic
display that involve similar issues of representation to bridge
this gap. Some principles of information design that have been
consistently identified, and broadly applied, are summarised in
Figure 1.</FONT></P>

Auditory Information Design</FONT></H3>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">The marriage of
principles for information design with observations about auditory
perception may produce the systematic approach to auditory display
called for by Bly. In the following sections each of the principles
is related to auditory perception. A small auditory example of
each principle is provided to help get a feel for how it might
apply in practice. The principles are then tried out on a design
of an auditory display for Bly&#146;s dirt and gold scenario..
The examples and final display can be generated with Csound.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Principle of
Directness</FONT></H3>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">The most direct
representation is the one with the shortest psychological description.
A less direct scheme exacts a penalty in mental workload that
will become apparent by poorer performance under stress [Norman
D.A. (1991)]. A direct representation can be understood with little
training, can be understood almost immediately, and allows judgements
that are not readily swayed by the opinions of others. [Ware C.
(1993)]. Some examples of direct representations are scatterplots,
satellite images, and geiger counters. On the other hand, conventional
symbols need to be learnt or looked up in a legend, are usually
read one at a time, and operations with them may be limited by
the 7 item limit of human short term memory. Conventional symbols
have the advantage that they can carry complex concepts built
upon on layers of learnt reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Different degrees
of directness are demonstrated by the displays that may be generated
from Figure 2 and Figure 3. The scenario is a mine rescue in which
you might imagine that you have an instrument that measures the
level of a dangerous gas as a reading between 0 and 9. The more
direct display is a geiger counter-like granular synthesis where
the density of grains increases with the level of gas. The other
display is a morse code signal that taps out the level as a series
of long and short tones. A short walk along the mineshaft is simulated
by a set of instrument readings. Generate and listen to each walk-through.
You can tell immediately when there is more gas with the geiger
counter. The morse code is exact, but has to be looked up or learnt.
It is suited to robust communications of more complex messages.</FONT></P>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">A representation
should provide the information required by the task: neither more
nor less [Norman D.A. (1991)]. If the task requires qualitative
information then use a qualitative representation. If the task
requires quantitative information then use a quantitative representation.
For example you can support the task of finding a country on a
globe by colouring the countries in qualitatively different hues.
If the task is to find the country with the highest rainfall then
hues would make this difficult because they do not look ordered
and you cannot compare them. To design an appropriate representation
you need to be able to describe the information that is required.
Information can be described as one of four types - nominal, ordinal,
interval and ratio, shown in Figure 4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">The information
types are further characterised by elementary relations of difference,
order, metric and zero that are the building blocks of more complex
information structures. Order is a directed difference, which
might be expressed as more or less, or low and high. Metric is
an equal unit of difference that is consistent, for example a
1 degree rise in temperature is the same no matter what the current
temperature is. Zero is a point of correspondence between all
scales independent of unit, so for example zero rainfall is the
same whether your rain gauge is in mm or inches. The elementary
information relations are described in Figure 5.</FONT></P>

of similarity between music and colour structure due to correspondences

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">To recap - we
started with a description of four types of information characterised
by lower level building blocks of difference, order, metric and
zero. These building blocks were also used to describe perceptual
relations with similar properties. This gives us the opportunity
to construct a faithful mapping of an information type to a perceptual
representation. If we can realise the perceptual building blocks
as auditory relations then the process can be used to design faithful
auditory representations for a general range of information types.
The following examples demonstrate that the perceptual building
blocks can be heard in auditory relations, as required by this
process. The demonstrations can be generated with Csound. To save
some space the headers in Figure 7 are common to all the following
orchestras and scores.</FONT></P>

different sounds can be easily generated by plugging in parameters
to a synthesis instrument. The demonstration is an fm instrument
and a score that generates a sequence of three different sounds,
shown in Figure 8. You can hear that the sounds are different
by listening to the sequence in a loop. It can take some fiddling
with parameters to ensure that the sounds are more than a little
different from one another. When the sounds are not very different
you can hear a double sound in the loop. As you adjust the parameters
you may get a feel for the folds, flat regions and non-linearities
in the mapping from synthesis parameters to perceived sounds.
This can be a problem if a display simply connects data values
to synthesis parameters, because some differences may be undetectable,
and others may be exaggerated.</FONT></P>

Range</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Any undetectable
element is useless. Utilise the entire range of variation [Bertin
J. (1981)] The number of differentiated elements that can be obtained
from a display depends on the available range of variation. People
can&#146;t hear the pitch of frequencies below 20 Hz in which
case human hearing is the limiting factor. Some devices can&#146;t
play frequencies above 4 kHz, in which case the device is the
limiting factor. The range of perceptual variation available on
a given device can be measured and represented by a display gamut
[Barrass S. (1994a)]. The knowledge of a gamut allows the designer
to maximise the difference between display elements. If the display
is to be transported to other devices the intersection of the
gamuts may be factored into the display design to ensure the capability
to reproduce information relations. The effect of available range
is demonstrated by the orchestra and score in Figure 12. The sequence
consists of 4 levels of rainfall {none, light, medium, heavy}
mapped to loudnesses of (0, 40,60,80} dB. This demonstration assumes
that you can easily change the loudness setting of your audio
equipment. Generate the sequence and turn the loudness knob down
low to avoid the risk of an uncomfortably loud sound. Start playing
the sequence in a loop and adjust the loudness knob to a comfortable
level. Can you hear the 3 sounds that correspond with light, medium
and heavy rain? You might notice that the equal differences in
dB of loudness do not really sound equal at all, an observation
that lead Stevens to propose a new law of psychophysics which
states that psychological judgements are based on ratios in stimulus,
rather than differences [Stevens S.S. (1962)]. Turn the loudness
knob down until the light rain can no longer be heard. If the
display were used in this condition there would be no way to hear
information about periods of light rain. A display that relies
on loudness will need to be calibrated to ensure the that all
the elements are discriminable. Some attributes, like duration
are not so susceptible to device settings or characteristics,
and may be a better option for a portable display.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Bregman first
noticed streams whilst investigating phonemes in speech. He wondered
whether non-speech sounds would hold together the way spoken phonemes
do. To find out he concatenated 26 sounds such as water splashing
in a sink, a doorbell, and a dentist&#146;s drill to form a sentence
of mock phonemes. He found that the sentence did not sound like
speech at all, even when it was played at speech rates of 10 phonemes
per second. Parts of the sentence seemed to pop-out, and the order
of the phonemes was disrupted. We can repeat this experiment with
the fm sounds from Figure 8. Play the looped sequence at the slow
rate of 1 sound per second and notice that you can easily write
down the order of the three sounds. Now speed it up to 10 sounds
per second by changing the tempo in diff.sco from 60 beats per
minute (t 0 60) to 600 beats per minute (t 0 600). Play the loop
and try to write down the order again - this time it will be very
difficult to tell which sound comes after which. This is because
the sounds have segregated into different auditory streams. The
segregation of elements into streams can make simple tasks like
counting much harder. Some consequences of streaming for auditory
display are</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">An understanding
of the factors that influence streams can guide the design of
a higher level display. As mentioned earlier, there is a global
level and a local level. The global level, or primitive process,
is a default bottom up grouping by acoustic factors such as spectral
similarity. The local level, or schema process, allows the listener
to alter the default grouping by mental effort. Mental schemas
detect familiar acoustic patterns and draw attention to them.
These Schemas are a top down process that explains why what we
hear depends so much on attention and previous listening experience.
In this view, the characteristics of sounds are calculated from
streams, not directly from the acoustic array. This is very different
from a straight forward signal processing model of auditory perception.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">The factors that
influence the primitive process operate sequentially across time,
and simultaneously across the spectrum. The perception of a new
sound depends on the streams that exist when it is introduced.
Parts that are acoustically similar to an existing stream will
be grouped with it, leaving the residue to be heard as the new
sound. This is called the old-plus-new heuristic, and it implies
that the sequential factors that capture recent auditory context
tend to override the moment to moment spectral factors. A listing
of factors in order of influence can be made from results of experiments
that have placed various factors in competition. The sequential
factors are toward the top of the list. This listing may provide
a basis for controlling the primitive grouping of elements in
a higher level auditory display.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Principle of
Organisation</FONT></H3>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Useful information
involves regrouping. The interactive reorganisation of relations
between elements can uncover information in the interplay of the
data [Bertin J. (1981)]. Bertin demonstrates by permuting matrices
of visual elements so they group in different ways to reveal information
about the peak booking periods in a hotel. The useful information
does not correspond with the values of the individual elements
(such as age, profession etc.) but with the structures formed
by the interplay of these elements with each other as a whole.
Bertin&#146;s display consisted of cards with simple marks on
them, such as dots that vary in size, that could be moved around
on a table top. Only the spatial organisation of the elements
is permuted, not any of the other visual variables such as lightness
or size. This is because you can only see two distinct cards if
they have different positions on the table, or are in the same
place at different times. This is why space and time are called
the &quot;indispensable&quot; dimensions of a visual display..
Elements that use up an indispensable dimension constrict the
options for permutation. For example a time series plot uses up
the horizontal dimension, leaving only the vertical for permutation.
A map uses up both the horizontal and vertical dimensions and
so cannot be permuted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Streaming experiments
have shown two sounds can occupy the same space and time but still
be heard as separate identities when they occupy different parts
of the spectrum. It seems that the auditory display designer has
a great deal of freedom to organise and reorganise display elements.
The degree of freedom rests upon the capabilities of the display
device. A display that uses Csound may employ multiple synthesis
parameters to reorganise spectral relations. The score events
can be organised to separate elements in time. A quadraphonic
pan is available that can provide a degree of separation in space.
Interactive permutation and exploration is supported by real-time
input sensors. A limiting factor is the amount of computation
required to generate the sounds in real time. Any apparent lag
in reaction can compromise the usability of an interactive display.
One way to address this problem is to design the synthesis to
be as computationally simple as possible. Another way is to take
advantage of fast hardware for audio synthesis.</FONT></P>

to Work</FONT></H3>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">So far we&#146;ve
borrowed some principles of information design from graphic designers,
and tried some simple demonstrations to get a feel that they may
be of benefit in the design of auditory displays as well. The
next step is to try them out in the design of an actual display.
In this instance I have chosen Bly&#146;s dirt and gold scenario
because it is a good example of the type of activity where sounds
may provide information that is difficult to obtain visually,
and it is a reference for other investigators. Here is the problem
scenario described by Bly ...</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;Can you
find the gold ?&quot; It is hypothesised that six different aspects
of the land in which gold may be found are determinative of whether
or not gold is there. The first 20 data variables (each 6-d) are
from sites known to have gold; the second 20 data variables are
from sites known not to have gold. For each of the remaining 10
data variables, decide for each whether or not it is from a site
with gold.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">The data set
consists of 100 samples generated from a normal random deviate
generator and then separated into two distinct sets. Only samples
in which all six variables had positive values between 0.0 and
3.5 were included. A sample s=(x21,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6) belongs to
Set 2 (dirt) if</FONT></I></P>

</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">At least five
of the six variables in each sample of Set 2 have a value less
than 1.5 and at most one of x1,x2,x3 have a value greater than
1.5. The 2 sets are completely distinct only in six-space; any
representation in fewer dimensions will overlap Set 1 and Set
2.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Before we begin
the design we must be clear about the information that is required
by the task, and the data elements that are involved. A task analysis
and data characterisation can help specify the design of a useful
display [Barrass S. (1996c)]. Bertin observes that &quot;useful
information is the answer to a question&quot; [Bertin J. (1981)].
The question in the scenario is &quot;can you find the gold?&quot;,
which has the useful answers {yes, no}. A direct display will
allow the listener to give one of these answers almost immediately,
without extensive training, and with confidence to resist instructional
bias. The first step in the design of the direct display is an
appropriate representation of the display elements. Each sample
is comprised of 6 ratio variables that are characterised by quantitative
difference, order, metric and a zero. We could map these to perceptual
building blocks with the same characteristics. However it is not
the individual measurements that are of interest, but the samples
themselves. The appropriate display is one that allows the difference
between gold and dirt to be heard by an auditory difference, not
one that allows us to hear measurements that are part of the samples.
In the demonstration of the principle of difference we found that
the fm algorithm in Figure 8 could produce quite different sounds
and hence may be appropriate for a display of difference between
the dirt and gold elements. Of course there are many other synthesis
algorithms that could also be tried, the important point is that
they have 6 parameters that cause perceptual difference. Having
selected a synthesis mapping we need to check the range on the
display device. In this case the number of differential elements
is only two - yes and no. The scaling of the parameters needs
to be adjusted to ensure that representative pairs of gold and
dirt can be discriminated in the display. The orchestra has a
global scaling factor gis, but individual elements may also be
adjusted if necessary. Some representative pairs to tune the range
against are in rangeok.sco shown in Figure 17. Different pairs
are selected by uncommenting them in the score file.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">It is easy to
tell the pairs of sounds apart with this display, which indicates
that the range is ok. It is also easy to tell different gold samples
apart, which is not such good news because this is more information
than we need to answer the question. Although the display enables
people to answer the question &quot;is this sample gold?&quot;
quite accurately, it only answers a question about a local element.
A more useful higher level display would enable the listener to
answer the question &quot;is there any gold in all this dirt?&quot;
quickly and directly. The principle of level raised the possibility
of streaming as a way to construct a higher order auditory display.
In the demonstration we found that the fm sounds tend to segregate
if they are played at speech rates of 10 per second. Perhaps we
can calibrate the fm parameters so that gold tends to segregate
from the dirt. This can be done using a sequence of dirt-gold-dirt-silence,
shown in levelok.sco in Figure 19. If you listen to this sequence
in a loop you will hear the gold as a high stream that is distinctly
separate from the low stream made of the two different dirt samples.
The gold clearly segregates for these samples, but should this
not be the case then the fm parameters may be tuned to cause segregation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">According to the
principle of organisation we may also take advantage of spare
indispensable dimensions to improve the separation of the answers.
At the moment we are only using the spectral dimension of the
display. However the soil samples have no intrinsic order in space
or time, leaving these indispensable dimensions spare. The Csound
pan command can provide spatial separation for two data measurements.
The temporal separation is not so easy in Csound because a start
and duration for each event has to be specified up front in the
score, and cannot be varied by the measurement fields. My solution
was to copy one of the measurements into the start field. The
result is a redundant mapping of 3 of the 6 measurements in the
samples to spare indispensable dimensions which may improve the
perception of the answer categories. The display is presented
as a Csound instrument called gold.orc in Figure 20. You can listen
to a handful of dirt and a handful of gold (which are in fact
Bly&#146;s training sets) with the scores in Figure21. Listen
to each to get a feel for how some typical dirt and gold samples
sound. The try listening to the mixture of dirt and gold from
Bly&#146;s first test set that is listed in goldtest1.sco in Figure
22. You can immediately tell that there is gold in this test set,
demonstrating that the display answers the question at a high
level. The local question can be answered by slowing down the
display rate, either by editing the tempo in the score, or playing
the sequence with a tool that allows variable rate playback. Intermediate
structure may be heard by altering the rate of presentation so
that different streams pop-out. As the rate slows the streams
become broader and encompass more elements. This effect is akin
to a visual zoom that shows detail at different scales. If you
have an ear for gold you can mix up your own sets from the training
sets, or you can generate new samples from the equations. The
orchestra may be simple enough to allow real-time interaction
from score statements generated on the fly.</FONT></P>

Summary</FONT></H3>

</h3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">Sounds are useful
in everyday activities and they can also be useful in abstract
information processing activities. The advent of faster audio
synthesis hardware has potential to allow auditory displays to
become common in many as yet unforeseen computer-based activities.
However auditory display is still a new field and the designer
is faced with some difficult challenges, due to the type of information
to be represented, the need for consistent comprehension, and
the need to support interactive exploration. The lack of a systematic
approach for mapping data into sounds has been identified as a
gaping hole that is impeding progress in this field of practise.
One way to bridge this gap is to borrow some principles that have
been developed by graphic designers faced with similar issues.
Principles of directness, appropriateness, range, level, and organisation
have appeared consistently and been applied broadly, and may also
be helpful in auditory display. The integration of these principles
with psychoacoustic observations may provide the systematic approach
that has been called for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman">This suggestion
was investigated by a demonstration of each principle in the context
of auditory display. The demonstrations show that the principles
could apply to sounds. The next step was to find out whether they
were of any benefit in practise. Bly&#146;s dirt and gold scenario
was chosen as a test bed because it is an example of information
that may be difficult to display and understand visually, and
because it is a reference for other designers. The resulting display
may allow a listener to hear information about gold and dirt that
can allow direct answers to the question &quot;is there gold?&quot;
at local and global levels. The important thing is that these
principles demonstrably do address important issues and do provide
a useful method for auditory information design. If you are interested
in digging up more information about auditory display a good place
to start is the International Community of Auditory Display (ICAD)
