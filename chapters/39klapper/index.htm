<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Magdalena Klapper</FONT></H2>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I started working with Csound
two years ago. After some experiences with other musical programmes
I had at that time, I remember it as a meeting with the real world
of computer music. So I made friends with Csound at once and became
fond of it for the liberty it gives me as a composer working with
this programme.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&quot;adeson TN&quot; is my first
piece composed with Csound. The basic idea of this piece was to
process the voice of my very good friend and excellent jazz singer
Kinga Studnicka in many various ways.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Preparations</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The realisation of &quot;adeson
TN&quot; is mainly based on the processing of recorded and sampled
sounds. I prepared three groups of sound material for this piece.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first group contained recordings
of Kinga's voice, which were made in sound proof chamber at the
University of Mining and Metallurgy in Cracow. I recorded one
by one the letters of the Polish alphabet, each in three versions:
whisper, speech and scream.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second group consisted of
about ten sounds of gongs, which differed in length, pitch and
tone colour. These sounds make up the background of the piece.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The last group contained sounds
registered from medical equipment during an echocardiographical
examination of the heart. These sounds were not used directly
in the piece, but their purpose was to modify other sounds. Two
very important features of these recordings were a very wide spectrum
and a stable but not periodical (!) pulse. After filtering the
echo-sounds were used as control signals in Csound to form an
envelope of single harmonics amplitudes of computer generated
sound. What is the most important, it breaks out the sound periodicity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The basic principle for &quot;adeson
TN&quot; was to take human speech as an instrument rather then
a source of information. A word (a group of letters) has its musical
colour, and it does not matter whether it means something or not
from the linguistic point of view. Such an approach allows the
group of letters from the title to be the musical theme of the
piece.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Initiation</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first part of the piece is
a theme introduction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The theme was constructed of seven
letters (vowels and consonants) ,which were chosen so as jointly
to create an interesting structure. It should be stressed that
not only the tone colour but also the element of rhythm is of
importance here. Vowels and consonants form two alternating groups
in the theme. They are always placed opposite one another during
the theme exposition, for instance by a different localisation
in space. They also accrue separately. The theme envelope usually
passes from an undetermined, uncertain situation, which is expressed
by using whispered, noisy sounds, towards concretization illustrated
as an estimation of pitch (through spoken sounds to screams at
the end).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this part voice processing
causing a timbre deformation is rather limited, to let a listener
easily recognise the speech. What gives rise to interest in a
listener is an untypical and modified amplitude of spoken sounds,
which is something new and not natural. In the next part of the
piece a direction of timbre processing is much more advanced and
leads to a complete change of tone colour and character of voice
sounds, as it almost can not be associated with speech. So the
purpose of the first part is to show the theme and other musical
material and also to prepare a listener for later forthcoming
changes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We should try at the moment to
look at how the above mentioned principles of the structure of
the piece are realised when using Csound algorithms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Working on speech processing in
the first part of the piece I used most often instruments number
1, 2, 5, 6 and 9. A few of them may seem to be quite similar but
they differ in some important details. All of these instruments
read sound file using 'soundin' or 'loscil' opcodes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 1 simply reads sounds
and places them in one particular point in space between the left
and right loudspeaker. Simple amplitude modification is also possible.
Instrument 2 lets the sound move fluently in space, which gives
more extensive possibilities, than in instrument 1. We can observe
in this example, in spite of its triteness, how the musical material
can be developed step by step in the piece.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 2 lets us also change
the sound pitch in a simple way. The main purpose of this instrument
is to create (by discreet pitch transposition) various human voice
timbres. We have recordings of one person voice, but in the piece
we can compose a crowd of speaking people (men, women or children),
or even something like a singing choir, if we wish. This way of
changing the pitch causes a change of sound duration, because
of how the 'loscil' opcode acts. Usually this is a rather undesirable
effect, but in this particular case the pitch change after the
transposition is small enough (to not deform sound too much) to
let the duration change of the sound remain unnoticed by a listener.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 5 extends our possibility
of sound processing with a more advanced amplitude modification.
The amplitude is controlled by a periodical signal, the pattern
of which is held in a score table, and may be repeated with a
frequency changing in different ways. Also sound frequency in
this instrument may be changed fluently, so we can obtain the
effect of glissandi. Instrument 6 is almost the same as instrument
5, but it offers a very specific amplitude modification. The amplitude
control signal has two segments of linear or exponential shape.
Besides the combinations lin-lin and exp-exp, which are not unusual,
there are also possible mixed combinations lin-exp and exp-lin
in amplitude envelope, which are much more interesting from the
musical point of view.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 9 takes in great part
in the development of the element of rhythm in the first part
of the piece. This algorithm uses 'comb' opcode, which adds to
the sound an iterated echoes. Then the sound (with echo) is filtered
by two band-pass filters with different centre frequencies. The
band widths are large at the beginning and gradually narrow, which
produces an effect of sound division. At first, the echoes are
well-ordered and became more and more irregular for further sounds.
This irregularity is obtained by overlapping firs two, then three
sounds (played of instrument 9) with different echo frequencies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now we can sum up how the group
of voice sounds is introduced and processed in the first part
of the piece. The character of speech is altered from whisper
at the very beginning (the first theme exposition) to screams
in the first part climax (the echo series are presented at that
moment) and then back to whisper, but a little deformed to prepare
a listener to the next part of the piece. The voice is processed
mainly in the direction of amplitude modifications and building
compact structures of many sounds (talking crowds), to let a listener
recognise a speech, but also to attract his attention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the first part of the piece
the sounds which originate from recorded gongs also appear. Their
aim was to create a background and musical setting of the theme.
Sounds based on gongs are mysterious, even a little sinister and
do not resemble anything of the real word. They have a character
of very singular, colourful noise. Let us focus on how these sounds
were constructed with Csound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is no special instrument
in the orchestra to produce these gong-sounds. They are clusters,
which came into existence by transposition of a sample of gong
to different pitches and then putting together the result. So
the method is extremely simple, but the musical effect quite fascinating
(mainly because of the gong sound properties). The structure of
the gong-cluster is shown in the picture below.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Figure 1.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
The structure of the cluster based on the gong sample. The gong
sample is a single line in the right of left side of the picture
The beginnings of all the transposed samples (reversed in the
left and not reversed in the right side) meet at the middle of
the cluster.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Because the sound of a gong has
quite a wide spectrum, the clusters made of a gong sample has
a character of noise, rather then a set of distinguishable pitches.
The pitch transposition of gong sample results in the change of
its duration. As all the samples meet together at one point in
the middle of the sound (like the picture shows), higher frequencies
appear later and decay earlier then lower, which causes an effect
of the sound approaching and receding. Additionally, components
of the cluster differ in the left-right side localisation. So
the movement of sound has two dimensions: front-back and left-right
(in the second case every partial moves separately). The relation
of pitches of the cluster components creates sense of specific
harmony, expressed by the colour of noise. Pitch intervals which
were employed in cluster construction were minor and major 3rds
and major 2nds (the frequency scaling factors 3/4, 4/5, 5/6 were
used during sample reading with the 'loscil' opcode). Major triads
were used most often.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Playing with Sound</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After acquainting a listener with
the musical material in the first part (sounds and tones, but
also musical structures), further work on the piece was an excellent
and amusing play with sound for me. I indulged myself in far interference
into the sound structure and strong deformation of its character,
especially the tone colour. I have also in consideration a development
and processing of the musical motifs from the first part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the second part I used much
more letters then the seven in the theme. There are a few directions
of speech treatment in this part.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One direction is a continuation
of the way from the firs part. Voice is not deformed very much,
so it may be recognised easily, however more letters (different
tones) are involved now. Letters are arranged in phrases of precisely
chosen tone colour and rhythm, so they create a sense of mystery
and anxiety. The principle of altering from whisper to scream
is abided here as well.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are compact sound structures
also created, based on one letter iterated with the irregular,
fast rhythm, different amplitude and space localisation. It makes
an effect, which may be compared to a choir of persons, who mimic
each other. Such structures (each of them based on other letter)
are overlapped, which is a source of a strong tension increase
in the piece, and is used to create local and global climaxes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Before we pass on to another direction
of speech treatment let us focus on the instrument 10 from the
orchestra file for a while. This instrument is the most important
algorithm of speech processing I have designed for this piece.
It is based on an additive analysis and resynthesis. Sound files
of recorded voice were analysed with usage of &quot;hetro&quot;
utility programme, which created for every sound file its accessory
file with the results of an additive analysis. The analysis results
were used by instrument 10 to resynthesize the sound files with
possibility of fluent modification of the amplitude, frequency
and speed of contributing partials. What effect is obtained as
the result of this process, from the musical point of view? First
of all, instrument 10 is able to transpose voice to different
pitches without any change of its duration, and on the contrary,
the duration may be changed with no pitch transposition (in other
words, change of the pitch and change of the length are independent).
Secondary, an additive analyse cause an interesting spectrum deformation,
especially in case of unvoiced speech sounds, what is connected
with speech sounds properties. The analysis parameters selection
caused &quot;combing out&quot; from sampled speech sounds 30 to
50 harmonics. Other components and additional murmurs were cut
off. It concerns especially unvoiced speech sounds because its
non harmonic spectrum was changed to harmonic, which caused a
of large deformation of its tone. This deformation may be so extreme,
that a listener could not guess that the sound origins from the
speech sample.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 10 was used to create
two classes of sounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first class consists of clusters
built of vocal sounds transposed to different pitches. On the
contrary to the gong-clusters from the first part, components
of these clusters have audible pitch and create substantial harmonisation.
The most often used intervals are minor and major 3rds, like in
the firs part. The pitch of each component is not stable, but
revolves near the basic frequency, which brings a significant
diversity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sounds of the second class appear
in the climax of the piece. They combine the two methods mentioned
above: the compact sound structures and the additive analysis
and resynthesis of voice. Sounds of speech based on simple voice
samples reading are gradually (with time) replaced by the same
voice samples processed with the 'adsyn' opcode (instrument 10),
which gives an effect of growing unreality of the sound. In the
climax of the piece this process is employed in different structures
(based on letters from the theme) at the same time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The background of the second part
of the piece is very uniform. It is created of samples of gong
sounds, which are read and processed with instrument 4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 4 reads samples from
a score table using 'table' opcode. The index of the table is
a control signal, so the sample may be read with fluent change
of speed. The shape of the index control signal is also read from
a score table with the 'table' opcode, but in this case the interpolating
version of this opcode must be used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The shapes of index signal I prepared
to process gong samples, consist of linear segments with different
gradients (like in the picture below).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="fig2.gif" WIDTH="513"
HEIGHT="202" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Figure 2.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
The example of the index control signal. The sample is read from
the end and changes the speed of reading three times with the
charge of the reading direction.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What is the interpretation of
using the signal like this one? The speed of sound reading within
one segment of the index control signal is constant, because of
its linear shape. But various gradients of segments define the
change of corresponded speeds. Additionally, a rising line means
the direction of reading from the beginning to the end, a sloping
line - the opposite direction. So gong samples are read piecemeal,
forward or backward, with the abrupt change of speed. Because
of the characteristic amplitude of a gong sample (short, steep
attack and long, slow decay), reading of this sample with a variable
direction produces long sounds with temporary amplitude accumulation
and subsidence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are two levels of gong sounds
produced in the same time during all the second part. One of them
consists of higher and faster changing sounds, the other one contains
of lower sounds, which amplitude changes are slower. Sounds of
both levels begin and end independently of themselves, and their
amplitude maximums &quot;miss&quot; each other. This process creates
the irregular, but uniform background.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Sounds of gong transposed to low
frequencies get a very beautiful, &quot;sandish reflection&quot;
in tone colour within high frequency range. Thank to this and
to the noisy character of gong sounds the background of the second
part has an unique tone and creates an impression of large space.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the second part a new group
of sounds also appear. They are based on the samples of echocardiographical
examination of the heart. The purpose of involving these samples
is to create a sound in a border-line of synthesis and recorded
material, it means the sound, which is synthesised by the computer,
but some elements of natural sounds are employed to this synthesis.
The advantage of such an approach is creation of the sound, which
has an unique tone colour (synthesised by the computer algorithm
and quite different from real word sounds), but also is devoid
of monotony connected with a periodical character of electronic
sounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I designed two Csound algorithms
to obtain this purpose: instrument 7, and its more advanced version
- instrument 8.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 7 generates a series
of sine harmonics. Harmonics are added in a loop, so the number
of the partials may be large, different for each sound and may
change with time (the loop condition is a control variable). Every
partial has its individual amplitude modification, which shape
is taken from the recorded &quot;echo-heart&quot; sound. &quot;Echo-heart&quot;
samples after reading by the 'soundin' opcode are divided into
many signals (as many as generated partials) by filtering the
source file with the different bands. In other words, the amplitude
control signal of partial x is the &quot;echo-heart&quot; signal
filtered by the band-pass filter with the central frequency equal
to the frequency of partial x. The filter band width is inversely
proportional to the number of partials. Thanks to this approach,
values of particular amplitudes are adequate to a frequency distribution
in the spectrum of the &quot;echo-heart&quot; sound. The &quot;echo-heart&quot;
signal has still very irregular amplitude after filtering (noisy
character), so it must be smoothing a little before partials modulation
(to not deform harmonic spectrum of generated sound very much).
Instruments 7 and 8 are examples of amplitude modulation. The
signals of filtered &quot;echo-heart&quot; change as well the
partials amplitudes as the spectrum of generated sound (so it
is already not strictly harmonic). If the amplitude modification
signal has a noisy character, a lot of additional frequencies
appear in generated sound, and it gets a noisy character too (what
is rather unwonted). There are three methods of smoothing possible
in instrument 7: based on 'rms', 'downsamp' and 'integ' opcodes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Instrument 8 limits the number
of harmonics to eleven, however their frequencies may move. This
possibility of fluent frequency change (different for different
partials) is one more step in the harmony envelope. All partials
are divided into two groups, and there are two rules (functions)
of frequency change defined, one for each group. It creates an
interesting effect of fast sound variability. The picture below
shows an example structure of a sound generated with instrument
8.</FONT></P>

The example of the harmonics frequencies movement.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The main advantage of &quot;echo-heart&quot;
sounds is their pulse (connected with heart beating). Sounds generated
with instrument 7 and 8 adopt this property, so they also have
the meaning as a rhythmical element in the piece, apart from an
interesting tone and sense of harmony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second part leads to the climax
of the piece and then to the return of the theme in its basic
form, which brings the piece to the end.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The piece has a classical form
ABA'C. Part A (described as the first one) and part B (described
as the second one) stand in contrast with each other. This contrast
is obtained mainly by enveloping and processing in the part B,
the music material and ideas introduced in the part A. Returning
of the theme in the piece climax closes the form. But only the
very beginning of the firs part is repeated (A'). The piece is
closed by the short fragment based on the gong sounds from the
second part, which lets the piece to gradually fade away. The
major triad appears at the very end to sum up the direction of
harmony envelope in the piece (C).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">My work with Csound is always
subordinate to the musical effect, and this is why I design most
of my orchestra instruments for the particular piece from the
beginning. Working with a recorded material, I do my best to exploit
its unique properties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But what I like in working with
Csound very much (because it is festinating and amusing) is a
contribution of fortune. My best algorithms designed with Csound
are result of either hard work and long searches, or simply accidental
mistake.</FONT></P>
