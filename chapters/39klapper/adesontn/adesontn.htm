		<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;adeson TN&quot; was composed in 1996 at the Studio of Electroacoustic Music in the Academy of Music in Cracow. The material I prepared for this composition consists of three groups of sounds. First of all the sounds of human voice, which were recorded in unechoic chamber. I recorded all alphabet letters separately, and then processed them using Csound algorithms. I would like to emphasise, that speech in this case has no informative meaning for me. The second group contains of the sounds of a medical equipment. They have an almost regular pulse, which is important to me. These sounds were filtered and used to control some parameters during FFT synthesis. As a result I received some synthetic sounds with a &quot;natural&quot;, nonperiodical pulse. In the last group I included sounds of a drum instrument. The composition was realised in Csound programme. All the sounds were processed with the usage of the algorithms I designed.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Times New Roman">The original title of the piece contains a letter specific to the Polish alphabet, which is similar in pronounciation to 'on'. Because the title is also the theme of the piece, one should remember that two letters from the title &quot;ades<b>on</b> TN&quot; have one-letter equivalent in the piece theme.</font></p>
