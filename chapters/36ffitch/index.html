<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">The Initial Spark<BR>
</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The genesis of a piece of music
is always problematical. The initial impulse to create <I>that</I>
piece rather than another can come from many sources, and also
from simultaneous sources. For me what starts my thoughts is usually
a timbre, or a philosophical idea, or possibly even a melodic
fragment. In a real sense <B>Drums and Different Canons</B> has
all these elements -- a marimba sound, a chaotic melody, and a
philosophical view of what makes music music.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At a more mundane level the first
step was reading the paper [Bidlack 1992] and I programmed part
of it to produce output to Csound, and borrowing a timbre from
Risset, showed the results to a student. We were both taken with
a short sequence of notes taken from this demonstration. It was
a mapping of the H&eacute;non difference equation simply onto
pitch and duration. As I listened a number of times I became aware
that the theme which had first caught my attention could be heard
at other moments in this simple mapping, and from that a whole
train of thoughts have arisen. The main one can be summarised
as an interest in patterns that almost repeat, but never quite
manage the same sequence. It was this which had struck me, and
I started thinking why this should be. It would be over simplistic
to trace these thoughts to the PhD thesis of Jeremy Leach [Leach,
1999], but we independently came to similar conclusions. Music
is about repetitions, but if that was all we would get bored very
soon. But if the repetition did not follow exactly the same pattern
we would have our interest regained.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As to why this should be, this
is not the place, but the reader is referred to the Leach thesis,
and his other papers [Leach &amp; Fitch 1995a, Leach 1995, Leach
&amp; Fitch 1995b, Leach 1996a, Leach 1996b], but the clue is
in evolutionary theory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Rather that follow that line of
enquiry I return to the piece of music. To follow what I heard
I needed to think about the general idea of non-exact repetitions.
In mathematics one can model these by a cyclic motion, where each
orbit does not join up exactly, or <I>ergodic</I> systems. As
a young mathematician quite by chance I had worked on differential
equations with similar features. A fellow student, now better
known for his work on Unix, was developing solutions to the orbit
of the Moon using the Hill&#151;Brown formulation [Bourne 1972],
and from him I learnt about the Hill equation;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As it was difficult to explain
to undergraduates when I came to lecture on the solution of such
equations my concentration changed to the Duffing equation:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/02.gif" HEIGHT="33"
WIDTH="76" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">a solution of which as a power
series in e and a Fourier series in time was required (see [Barton
&amp; Fitch 1972] for example).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the case of <B>Drums and Different
Canons</B> <B>#1</B> the equation used is the H&eacute;non equation
[H&eacute;non 1976 ] which is cast as a phase equation, in x and
y with time as the independent variable:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/03.gif" HEIGHT="36"
WIDTH="99" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and it is this form which I used.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Turning an Equation
Into a Score</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Of course the mathematical discussion
above is not about music. The task of an algorithmic composer
is to create algorithms, in my case based on beautiful mathematics,
into sonic realisations. In the case of <B>Drums and Different
Canons #1</B> will describe in detail the composition of the first
movement. This is the longest, and is subtitled Henon after the
equation on which it is based. I had already decided on a marimba-like
sound, because it is a timbre I admire, and the speed was basically
slow, but was adjusted as my thoughts developed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The H&eacute;non map gives value
of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> for each iteration, so I mapped <I>x</I>
onto pitch and<I> |y|</I> onto initiation time. The actual map
was</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">pitch <I>= 7.7 + 2.4 x</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">to give an octave and fraction.
I worked to a hundredth of an octave in equal steps, but the intention
was to avoid any particular scale. The duration was set arbitrarily
at 500 events, a number which fortuitously ended at the 'right'
place in the cycles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This gives the backbone of the
movement, but it was a little characterless to my ear. Two different
methods were used to embroider this. The first was to add a rhythmic
element, and the second was to add a second sound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In a simple way I wanted the piece
to be in&nbsp;<IMG SRC="figures/04.gif" HEIGHT="17" WIDTH="8"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> time, but of course the chaotic
nature of the note onsets meant that this could not be achieved
simply. The answer taken was to use amplitude increases for the
first note after or on the beat, with increases of 1000, 200,
700 or 200 units for the four beats. This seems to create a hesitating
beat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A second timbral element was then
added driven by the H&eacute;non map. Whenever the pitch fell
below a pitch of 5.0 in Csound's octave scheme, a sequence of
events is triggered. Initially I conceived of this as a hi-hat
sound, but during the composition this changed somewhat, although
in the programs it is still referred to as a cymbal. The sequence
was to take 7 events from the Torus map</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/05.gif" HEIGHT="35"
WIDTH="108" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">which both variables taken mod
<I>2p ,</I> and <I>K</I> a constant. Again we have to map these
two variables to musical parameters. To ensure greater variation,
the value of <I>K</I> was taken as <I>1 + t/10000</I> where <I>t</I>
is the time of the trigger. The pitch was&nbsp;<IMG SRC="figures/06.gif"
HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="52" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> for
the nth note and the speed of the gesture is controlled by Q with
onsets of&nbsp;<IMG SRC="figures/07.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="56"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM">. Additional digits from Q
_nare used for timbral parameters. The instrument is Risset's
finger cymbals.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">All that remains in the design
is to ensure that the program triggers the gesture at the start,
and that the last event is marked by another timbre, again from
Risset.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It should be emphasised that the
mappings above are all empirical, and represent the composer's
input to the piece. The original program which generated the Csound
score is given below.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">The Second and
Third Sections</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The piece stopped at just the
Henon movement for a long time. This changed after I attended
a computing conference at the Austrian town of Gmunden. On a free
rainy September afternoon I walked up the small mountain of Gr&uuml;nberg,
while listening to some Xenakis on a walkman, and returned via
the settlement of Mitterberg. There was something about the air,
the view, the smells, but most of all the sound which started
me thinking again about the single movement I had all but completed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On my return home I started working
on what became the second movement. Due to laziness I decided
to use the same events as the first movement, but the instruments
were to be drums, and it was to be played at about twice the speed.
Where in the first movement the stereo image was used just to
position the bars of the marimba, now the &#145;spare&#146; digits
were used to move the sounds in the stereo image. Rarely for me,
this section was completed in only a few weeks. It has been described
as pretty, but to me it is an echo of Henon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Similarly the same score is used
for the last movement, but two events were merged so there were
glissandi between two pitches. My intent here was to change the
mood to a distant memory of the Gr&uuml;nberg. The section was
written with a distant view of hills from my computer chair, and
this became for me a distant view of Austria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I do not reproduce the C program
for these two sections, but they follow the program I have given
in many details, including the triggers and rhythm.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">The Final Assembly</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">While tempted to write a fourth
movement, external forces drove me to conceive of the piece as
complete. But I was concerned about why it existed, and how it
could be heard with no human performers. In the event I created
a short introductory fanfare, which is actually a strict canon,
taken from another part of the H&eacute;non map, and using the
instruments which are used elsewhere. I hope by the device to
prime the ear to the sound world I wished to evoke. Somehow it
seemed essential to repeat the prelude as a closing statement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As I was finishing the piece I
needed a title, other than &quot;my current piece&quot;. The repetitive
or near repetitive structures, and my chosen instruments led me
to the title, an echo of the well known quotation from Thoreau.
I retained the titles of the now-five sections, but due to my
(minor) problem with dyslexia I omitted the accent from H&eacute;non,
and got the mountain's name wrong. But such a fracturing of reality
is totally in keeping with the underlying concept. Similarly I
have never really decided if it is about <B>Cannons</B> or <B>Canons</B>.
But does it matter?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You might wonder why the <B>#1</B>;
well I have <B>#2</B> under way, based on the Lorentz map, and
new sounds. Again the mechanism is an ANSI C program to generate
the score, and a great deal of experimentation to discover the
mappings.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If you like the piece <B>Drums
and Different Canons</B> <B>#1</B> then I have managed to convey
something of the amazing excitement and passion that mathematics
has always had for me.<BR>
