The system will 'render' the same script in stereo, Ambisonics or a crude mono (for speed).</p>		<p>Features include:		<ul>			<li>Delay lines are used to model the distance the sound is from the listener. Movement induces Doppler shift and separate delays are calculated to the two signals generated for stereo.			<li>Low-pass filtering and the inverse-square law are used to further process the signal as it travels long distances.			<li>Sounds may stay motionless, move in straight lines or along arcs.			<li>Pre-spatialised soundfiles can be mixed in although they must be the same format as output.			<li>Angled Cardioid Virtual Microphones are used to record the two signals used for stereo.			<li>Ambisonic decoding equations are included so the system can be modified to produce a four-speaker feed.			<li>Sounds are reflected off configurable walls within a simple room model generating early reflection images or cruder echoes. Reflected sound goes through all other processing. One of Eric Lyon's instruments is used to provide further reverberation.		</ul>		<p>This program was written on Linux and has been tested with IRIX. It should run without too much trouble on other UNIXes. It will not run with DOS or Windows because of a reliance on symbolic links.</p>		<p>The implementation works by shelling out to Csound so Csound needs to be available at run-time.</p>		<p>Compilation requires C, make, YACC and LEX.		<p>The system is straightforward to use once set up: mixing lines can be as simple as <nobr><code>2.5 bell1.wav at (0, 1, 0) </code></nobr>indicating that bell1.wav is to be played to the left of the listener 2.5 beats into the mix. Documentation of the syntax is included with the release.</p>		<p>Much of the processing is rather qualitative and not accurate representations of physics. The system is slow when asked for much detail. But it works for me.</p>		<p>To download version 1.06 click <a href="space106.tgz">here</a>. For updates to this and for other audio tools see <a href="http://www.muse.demon.co.uk">http://www.muse.demon.co.uk</a>.</p>		<p>To download an altogether older system for Ambisonics and Csound click <a href="oldambi.tgz">here</a>. This version is much more limited than Space but uses Csound only and not C, YACC or LEX.</p>		<p>Source code is in TGZ format (tar + gzip). See licences included.</p>		<p>For other Ambisonics information I recommend the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/mustech/3d_audio/ambison.htm">Ambisonics Page</a> maintained by Dave Malham of the University of York Music Technology group. For more general reading on 3D audio I would recommend &quot;3D Sound&quot; by Durand R. Begault (1994, Academic Press, Inc.) and the fiercely concise and technical, &quot;Digital Audio Signal Processing&quot; by Udo Zolzer (1997, John Wiley and Sons, also in German: 1995, B.G. Teubner Verlag). These books both give excellent set of references. &quot;Ambisonics&quot; is a registered trademark of Nimbus Communications International.</p>		<p>		<hr>		<p>The author<author>Richard Furse</author>can be emailed as <a href="mailto:richard@muse.demon.co.uk">richard@muse.demon.co.uk</a>.
