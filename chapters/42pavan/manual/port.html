The default value is 0.	<p><i>istor</i> - initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default value is 0.	<p><i>iscl</i> - coded scaling factor for resonators. A value of 1 signifies a peak response factor of 1, i.e. all frequencies other than kcf are attenuated in accordance with the (normalized) response curve. A value of 2 raises the response factor so that its overall RMS value equals 1. (This intended equalization of input and output power assumes all frequencies are physically present; hence it is most applicable to white noise.) A zero value signifies no scaling of the signal, leaving that to some later adjustment ( <a href="rms.html">see balance</a>). The default value is 0.	<h4><u>PERFORMANCE</u></h4>	<b>port</b> applies portamento to a step-valued control signal. At each new step value, <i>ksig</i> is low-pass filtered to move towards that value at a rate determined by <i>ihtim</i>. <i>ihtim</i> is the &quot;half-time&quot; of the function (in seconds), during which the curve will traverse half the distance towards the new value, then half as much again, etc., theoretically never reaching its asymptote. With <b>kport</b>,&nbsp; the half-time can be varied at the control rate.	<p><b>tone</b> implements a first-order recursive low-pass filter in which the variable <i>khp</i> (in cps) determines the response curve's half-power point. Half power is defined as peak power / root 2.	<p><b>reson</b> is a second-order filter in which <i>kcf</i> controls the center frequency, or cps position of the peak response, and <i>kbw</i> controls its bandwidth (the cps difference between the upper and lower half-power points).	<p><b>atone</b>, <b>areson</b> are filters whose transfer functions are the complements of <b>tone</b> and <b>reso</b>n. <b>atone</b> is thus a form of high-pass filter and <b>areson</b> a notch filter whose transfer functions represent the &quot;filtered out&quot; aspects of their complements. Note, however, that power scaling is not normalized in <b>atone</b>, <b>areson</b>, but remains the true complement of the corresponding unit. Thus an audio signal, filtered by parallel matching <b>reson</b> and <b>areson</b> units, would under addition simply reconstruct the original spectrum. This property is particularly useful for controlled mixing of different sources ( <a href="lpread.html">see lpreson</a>).	<p>Complex response curves such as those with multiple peaks can be obtained by using a bank of suitable filters in series. (The resultant response is the product of the component responses.) In such cases, the combined attenuation may result in a serious loss of signal power, but this can be regained by the use of <b><a href="rms.html">balance</a></b>.	<p>	<p>	<center>		<b><i><font color="#006600">HTML Csound Manual - <font size="-1">&copy; Jean Pich&eacute; &amp; Peter J.
