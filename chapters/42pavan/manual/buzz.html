In either case a large table of at least 8192 points is recommended.	<p><i>iphs</i> (optional) - initial phase of the fundamental frequency, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1). A negative value will cause phase initialization to be skipped. The default value is zero	<h4><u>PERFORMANCE</u></h4>	<i>kfrac</i> - fractional width of the pulse part of a cycle.<b> poscil</b> is a k-rate varying pulse-width audio oscillator, with on/off levels set to provide a zero-average DC offset. Although pulse-width oscillation is an unnatural signal (it does not occur in natural instruments), it is a popular source in synthesizers.	<p>The buzz units generate an additive set of harmonically related cosine partials of fundamental frequency <i>xcps</i>, and whose amplitudes are scaled so their summation peak equals <i>xamp</i>. The selection and strength of partials is determined by the following control parameters:	<p><i>knh</i> - total number of harmonics requested. Must be positive.	<p><i>klh</i> - lowest harmonic present. Can be positive, zero or negative. In <b>gbuzz</b> the set of partials can begin at any partial number and proceeds upwards; if <i>klh</i> is negative, all partials below zero will reflect as positive partials without phase change (since cosine is an even function), and will add constructively to any positive partials in the set.	<p><i>kr</i> - specifies the multiplier in the series of amplitude coefficients. This is a power series: if the <i>klh</i>th partial has a strength coefficient of A, the (<i>klh</i> + n)th partial will have a coefficient of A * (<i>kr</i> ** n), i.e. strength values trace an exponential curve. <i>kr</i> may be positive, zero or negative, and is not restricted to integers.	<p><b>buzz</b> and <b>gbuzz </b>are useful as complex sound sources in subtractive synthesis. <b>buzz</b> is a special case of the more general <b>gbuzz</b> in which <i>klh</i> = <i>kr</i>= 1; it thus produces a set of knh equal-strength harmonic partials, beginning with the fundamental. (This is a band-limited pulse train; if the partials extend to the Nyquist, i.e. <i>knh</i> = int (sr / 2 / fundamental freq.), the result is a real pulse train of amplitude <i>xamp</i>.) Although both <i>knh</i> and <i>klh</i> may be varied during performance, their internal values are necessarily integer and may cause &quot;pops&quot; due to discontinuities in the output; <i>kr,</i> however, can be varied during performance to good effect. Both <b>buzz</b> and <b>gbuzz</b> can be amplitude- and/or frequency-modulated by either control or audio signals.	<p>N.B. These two units have their analogs in <b><a href="gen11.html">GEN11</a></b>, in which the same set of cosines can be stored in a function table for sampling by an oscillator. Although computationally more efficient, the stored pulse train has a fixed spectral content, not a time-varying one as above.	<p>	<center>		<b><i><font color="#006600">HTML Csound Manual - <font size="-1">&copy; Jean Pich&eacute; &amp; Peter J.
