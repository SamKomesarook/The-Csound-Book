This can be as large as available memory will permit. The space required for n seconds of delay is 4n * <b>sr</b> bytes. It is allocated at the time the instrument is first initialized, and returned to the pool at the end of a score section.		<p><i>istor</i> (optional) - initial disposition of delay-loop data space ( <a href="port.html">see reson</a>). The default value is 0.		<h4><u>PERFORMANCE</u></h4>		<b>delayr</b> reads from an automatically established digital delay line, in which the signal retrieved has been resident for <i>idlt</i> seconds. This unit must be paired with and precede an accompanying <b>delayw</b> unit. Any other <b>Csound</b> statements can intervene.		<p><b>delayw</b> writes <i>asig</i> into the delay area established by the preceding <b>delayr</b> unit. Viewed as a pair, these two units permit the formation of modified feedback loops, etc. However, there is a lower bound on the value of <i>idlt</i>, which must be at least 1 control period (or 1/<b>kr</b>).		<p><b>delay</b> is a composite of the above two units, both reading from and writing into its own storage area. It can thus accomplish signal time-shift, although modified feedback is not possible. There is no minimum delay period.		<p><b>delay1</b> is a special form of delay that serves to delay the audio signal <i>asig</i> by just one sample. It is thus functionally equivalent to &quot;<b>delay</b> asig, 1/<b>sr</b>&quot; but is more efficient in both time and space. This unit is particularly useful in the fabrication of generalized non-recursive filters.		<h4><u>EXAMPLE:</u></h4>		<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>tigoto</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; except on a tie,&nbsp;&nbsp; a2&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>delay</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a1, .05, 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; begin 50 msec clean delay of sig&nbsp;&nbsp; contin:</pre>		<center>		</center>		<center>		</center>		<center>			<b><i><font color="#006600">HTML Csound Manual - <font size="-1">&copy; Jean Pich&eacute; &amp; Peter J.
