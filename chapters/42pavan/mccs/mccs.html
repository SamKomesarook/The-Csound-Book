Vercoe at the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT), is actually one of the most famous programs for sound synthesis, utilized by many composers and searchers in the whole world. Csound versions for many platforms can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>		<p><i>Musique concr&euml;te</i> (concrete music) is a term coined by the French composer Pierre Schaeffer in the first half of this century, to define a kind of music constituted by recorded sounds in the &quot;real world&quot;. These recordings were subjected to various treatments and manipulations, creating sound material for musical works. <i>Musique concr&euml;te</i>, at the beginning, was realized with analog equipment (in the early 1950s the tape recorder was adopted for use in this field) and the principal techniques for making this music were: cut and splicing, change of tape speed, tape delay, tape loops etc. In USA this kind of music was called &quot;tape music&quot;. With the evolution of new technologies these techniques are today obtainable with digital equipments. Csound achieves the same results that Schaeffer obtained in his study with the manipulation of analog tapes. The difference is that Csound works by a digital process. In this way the opportunities of sound manipulation are strongly increased.</p>		<p>MCCs comes from the idea to facilitate the composers that work with informatic technologies. The object of MCCs is the generation of scores that work with pre-existent sounds. The composer can interact with a simple interface, assigning the parameters to the composition; he has the opportunity to utilize some Csound capabilities without having a good knowledge of it. The program automatically generates the orchestra file and the score file; these files can be processed with Csound. The composer can select several general options: granular synthesis of input soundfile, filtering (with a 2nd order passband Butterworth filter), ring modulation, flanger, delay, local reverberation and global reverberation. These sound treatments can be carried out separately or together. Moreover in MCCs there are various predefined options and the possibility to assign aleatory values to the parameters. MCCs is written in Borland Pascal 7.0 and generates text format scores [.sco] for Csound synthesis (version 3.37 and following). MCCs generates, along with the score, an orchestra file [.orc], with the same name as the score. To obtain a processed sound, Csound is required in your hard disk. MCCs works with an input mono soundfile [.wav]. You have to answer a series of questions for setting score parameters. Some general options are possible, one by one or simultaneously (in the latter case the time for synthesis is longer). The file obtained after the synthesis will be a stereo soundfile. Near each question a unit of measurement is specified in square brackets. It is the unit of measurement of the parameters:</p>		<pre>[Hz] = Hertz[s]  = seconds[ms] = milliseconds</pre>		<p>When the question is about a quantity, there's a little explanation inside the brackets. For example:</p>		<pre>PITCH OF SOUND [1 = ORIGINAL PITCH OF INPUT SOUNDFILE]</pre>		<p>If the pitch of input soundfile is 1, it means that value 0.5 gives an output sound at half speed, and the sound will be transposed at the lower octave musical interval. If the pitch is 2, sound will be read at the higher octave with doubled speed. If one writes a very small value, (e. g. 0.01) the duration of sound would be very long; for this reason the following question is put:</p>		<pre>DO YOU WANT TO ASSIGN A MAXIMUM DURATION FOR EACH SOUND? (y/n)</pre>		<p>If the answer is affirmative, a maximum duration of sound/s is required.</p>		<center>			<p>*** *** *** ***</p>		</center>		<div align="left">			<p>The question</p>		</div>		<pre>DO YOU WANT SCALE AMPLITUDE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF SOUNDS? (y/n)</pre>		<p>refers to the possibility of a reduced amplitude of sounds, in case of a large number of sounds (to avoid overflow). When you are using the Butterworth filter, particularly with small bandwidth, the better thing is no amplitude reduction (because amplitude is already low).</p>		<center>			<p>*** *** *** ***</p>		</center>		<p>MCCs also allows the user to assign aleatory parameters in a definable range. For example the following question asks the user to define a time range in which sounds will have aleatory beginning times:</p>		<pre>MINIMUM VALUE OF BEGINNING TIMES IN ALEATORY RANGE [s]MAXIMUM VALUE OF BEGINNING TIMES IN ALEATORY RANGE [s]</pre>		<center>			<p>*** *** *** ***</p>		</center>		<p>One peculiarity of MCCs is the fine control of all the parameters, with many default choices (for example the <a href="#func">functions list</a>). Last question that is put is</p>		<pre>Do you want another set of sounds? (y/n)</pre>		<p>It lets a new cycle of questions for another group of sounds in the same score. As one can imagine the program is an instrument for musical composition, enabling the user (Csound expert or novice) to produce compositions. Creativity can be limited with programs like this, but on the other hand they can help those who do not know Csound but want to use some sound synthesis techniques.</p>		<p><a name="func"></a>		<hr>		</p>		<h3><b>Implemented functions in MCCs:</b></h3>		<blockquote>			<p><a href="../figures/f2.gif">f2: sinewave</a></p>			<h4><b>Linear envelopes:</b></h4>			<p><a href="../figures/f3.gif">f3: ascending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f4.gif">f4: descending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f5.gif">f5: ascending-descending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f6.gif">f6: descending-ascending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f7.gif">f7: trapezoidal</a></p>			<p><b>Exponential envelopes:</b></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f8.gif">f8: ascending exponential</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f9.gif">f9: descending exponential</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f10.gif">f10: ascending-descending exponential</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f11.gif">f11: descending-ascending exponential</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f12.gif">f12: trapezoidal exponential</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f13.gif">f13: bell function</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f14.gif">f14: narrow bell function</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f15.gif">f15: ascending-descending exponential for sound movement</a></p>			<p><b>Flanger and delay functions:</b></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f16.gif">f16: sinewave</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f17.gif">f17: ascending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f18.gif">f18: descending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f19.gif">f19: ascending-descending straight line</a></p>			<p><a href="../figures/f20.gif">f20: descending-ascending straight line</a></p>		</blockquote>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<h3><b>Executable file to run MCCs: <a href="mccs.exe">mccs.exe</a></b></h3>		<pre><hr><blockquote><a href="mccs.exe"><b>mccs.exe</b></a></blockquote></pre>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>References</b></p>		<p>Benade, A.
