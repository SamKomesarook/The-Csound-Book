<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">11. Cecilia: A Production Interface
to Csound</FONT></H1>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Jean Pich&eacute; with Alexandre
Burton</FONT></H2>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Introduction</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In 1994, it was becoming increasingly
evident that the future of electroacoustic composition resided
in the use of general-purpose computer workstations. The MIDI
protocol and its limiting event descriptors had long been a hindrance
to a sound-object approach to composition. The analog studio,
in many ways, had been more conducive to experimentation with
sound. By separating the control aspects of composition (midi
scores) and sound generation (midi synths and samplers), a vital
link was lost. It was becoming increasingly more difficult to
control synthesisers that, ironically, could generate more and
more complex sounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">With the power of current computers,
software synthesis and processing offered an attractive alternative.
Csound, as the &quot;grande dame&quot; of such programs became,
the basis for constructing a system where all processing functions
of the traditional studio would be ported and offered to the composer
in a digestible and intuitive form. Given Csound's terse command-line
interface, this was easier said than done. The system had to be
very responsive and not require that the composer be particularly
knowledgeable in the theories and practices of audio-processing.
In other words, the system had to accommodate the composer more
than the computer-music programmer. Yet, as one grew into the
use of more sophisticated techniques, the system also had to allow
an elegant shift to a more complex relationship to the inner resources
of Csound programming.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">After the system had been in use
for a period of time, it became evident that a practical and responsive
interface was more than a help to the neophyte. Many, if not most,
sound-processing tasks in electroacoustic music (particularly
in musique concrete/acousmatic music) rely on a relatively well
know subset of audio-processing techniques. In the end, it turned
out that Cecilia's &quot;preset&quot; modules philosophy, covering
the usual time-based and frequency-based audio processes, was
contributing to explosive productivity for seasoned composers
as much as the neophytes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our approach to Csound was as
a serious music production tool. Furthermore, our use of the language
was biased towards the production of sound-object oriented composition
sometimes referred to as &quot;musique concrete&quot; where sound
is, more often than not, obtained from previous recordings and
submitted to complex chains of transformations and reorganised
into final compositions in a fairly traditional multi-tracking
and mixing environment. In a general sense, Cecilia can be thought
of as a composition management system, bringing together under
one roof the many programs needed to run a successful composition
session. It proposes many tools of its own when needed but it
tries to use tools that are already available to the various computer
platforms used by composers.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Roadblocks to Productivity</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In examining a typical work session
with Csound, we have identified five important problem areas:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1- Many resources are needed:
  text editor, soundfile player, score generator, soundfile editor,
  etc. Each of these programs have to be managed. Files must be
  opened, processed, saved and closed and computations have to
  be launched. Time spent in these mundane tasks can easily up
  to more than 50% of a given session.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2- Music is a time-based form.
  All good electroacoustic music (specially sound-oriented composition)
  requires intimate control over sonic time profiles. Text is generally
  a poor descriptor of time-based functions. Csound offers precise
  control in the form of function tables but the representation
  is not intuitive and prone to guess-work leading to important
  productivity loss.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3- Interactivity is crucial to
  experimentation. Csound was designed initially as a &quot;batch&quot;
  program with few provisions for real-time interaction. The power
  of current computer technologies allows real-time processing
  but few tools are provided in Csound to make good use of it.
  Interaction is also the subject of issues raised in point 1.
  The &quot;back-and-forth&quot; loop of editing/hearing results
  must be streamlined for the quickest turn-around possible. For
  example, one key stroke should save changes, start Csound with
  correct settings, compute the samples and play the results.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4- Documentation and help when
  it is needed. Csound is too rich a language to memorize. Opening
  a manual and seeking general help is wasted time.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5- Score generation. The great
  weakness of Csound is score input. Complex notes lists are difficult
  and time-consuming to enter in text mode. While Cscore offers
  an interesting alternative, the writing of C programs is usually
  beyond the reach of most composers. For strictly sound-processing
  tasks, this problem is perhaps less of a hindrance because a
  score can then be specified as a simple scheduler for a process,
  but a more traditional score-oriented approach must rely on other
  programs (such as Common Music, Scot or even MIDI sequencers)
  to generate complex scores. Sometimes the generation of score
  fragments is as useful as controlling full compositions.</FONT>
</UL>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Design Philosophy</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In designing the Cecilia interface,
we wanted to address all the above issues offering within one
environment both power and generality. Cecilia is meant for both
the expert and the beginner. To the expert it should mean an easier
and direct access to the power of Csound, to the beginner it should
mean not even knowing that Csound is present.Cecilia should therefore
have a &quot;Production mode&quot;, where one works on sound with
a given set of controls and a &quot;Programming mode&quot; where
code is written for specific purposes. The program should also
provide means to gracefully slide continuously between the two
modes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In &quot;Production mode&quot;,
Cecilia should be usable with little or no interaction with Csound
proper. For example, should a composer wish to filter or &quot;flange&quot;
a soundfile, Cecilia should provide a module that only requires
input for the soundfile to process with a graphical and real-time
interface to specify and &quot;play in&quot; all control variables.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In &quot;Programming mode&quot;
, Cecilia's principal job should be to assist the programmer in
designing orchestras quickly and efficiently. The system should
therefore know about Csound, offer a very fast turn-around time
for testing and provide instant documentation for opcodes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In both modes, a file management
system should be provided to save orchestras and scores as single
documents while preserving the flexibility of using the same orchestra
with different scores. Orchestras and scores should be recallable
from menus and cascades. In designing an interface, it is easy
to oversee small details where important productivity gains can
be made. For example, a knowledgeable file browser can save a
tremendous amount of work if it provides a means of listening,
editing sounds and deleting files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Designing Cecilia was a multi-step
process, beginning with a suitable Csound editor, a file management
system and a responsive help mechanism. Tcl/tk was chosen as the
development language for a number of reasons:it is multi-platform,
is relatively easy to learn, comes with a full set of interface
objects and is fast enough for the purpose of responding to user-input.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cecilia runs on Unix, Macintosh,
Windows and Linux platforms.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Main Cecilia Window<BR>
</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Fig.

The Main Cecilia window is where all Csound computation options
and variables are chosen.<BR>
When one or more sound choosers are specified in the interface
declaration, they also appear here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The toplevel window of Cecilia
is where all Csound computation options are set. All settings
are done under menu controls. Output file management tasks are
also done here: Specifying output sound file name, choosing sampling
rate and control rates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A special module cascade allows
the storage of any number of modules for instant recall. The standard
Cecilia modules are stored here. A user cascade is also available
for organisation of modules, orchestras and scores.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This window is also used to choose
soundfile input for a given module/orchestra. When a file object
is declared in the interface pane of the editor (see further),
a selector appears here. Pushing the button brings up a file browser
for selecting a soundfile. The file button is also useful for
selecting sound-analysis data files.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In an effort the integrate all
the tools needed in a working session, a number of utilities are
directly available through menus. All sound analysis programs
are available at this level with special graphical interfaces
for choosing sounds and specifying parameters of the analysis.
Launching auxiliary programs can also be done with the main window
menus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In any location where sound is
likely to be present, such as the file selector, the output and
input slots, Cecilia always offers buttons for playing or editing
the target soundfile.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Cecilia Editor<BR>

The Cecilia editor is where orchestras, scores and interface objects
are entered.<BR>
The editor is a multi-pane window and is optimised for orchestra
and score development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The editor is the centre of Cecilia
even though it is not necessary to use it to make sounds. The
Cecilia editor is a multi-pane window where orchestras, interface
objects and scores are defined. The document it reads and writes
is a called a module. Typically a module includes an orchestra
and a score, an information section describing its functionalities,
an interface definition for any object used by the orchestras
and/or score. An orchestra can come in three flavours:mono, stereo
or quad depending on the output desired. The editor is optimised
for Csound editing:</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Opcode insertion - A hot-key
  brings up a panel containing all Csound opcodes. Selecting an
  opcode inserts it with default values at the cursor position.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Error reporting - When
  an error is detected upon computation, the editor reports the
  error at the offending line in the text itself by selecting the
  offending syntax.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Instant help - A hot-key
  with a selected opcode in the text opens the manual at the proper
  page for instant documentation.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Special soundfile information
  commands - A number of special commands are offered for soundfile
  data gathering directly in the text. Thus, one can directly find
  the correct size of a file, its number of sample frames, sampling
  rate and number of channels.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Computation hot-keys -
  While in the editor, a hot-key launches Csound computations with
  the current document for writing to sound file or listening directly
  through the converters. Computations are carried with the current
  contents of the editor hence it is unnecessary to save the document
  before computation.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Opcode colorizing - Opcodes,
  comments and special commands can be colorized for easy parsing.</FONT>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">&#149; Score handling - The editor
  discriminates between different types of scores with a leading
  keyword. For example, a score beginning with the keyword #min
  will automatically generate a score containing a single note
  whose duration will be equal to the longest input soundfile.
  See the &quot;Handling scores&quot; section for further examples.</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To facilitate file management,
Cecilia modules are saved as single text files that include interface,
orchestra and score definitions. The document structure is entirely
editable outside of Cecilia.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Interface Objects</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One of the obstacles to doing
useful work with Csound is the description of time-variant functions.
Such functions can, in some case, be described mathematically
but in most cases, a form of visual representation is essential
to make them useful. Real-time interaction is also a kind of function
descriptor that is not supported by text. Cecilia solves these
two problems with a set graphical tools that pass data to a module
or orchestra via regular Csound global variables. To do so, Cecilia
reserves the use of instrument numbers from 100 upwards.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1- The Graphing Tablet<BR>
</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/03.gif" WIDTH="806"

</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Fig.
3</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">
The Graphing tablet is used to enter functions with the mouse.<BR>
Functions are passed on to the orchestra via global variables.
<BR>
A number of preset functions are offered.<BR>
On computation, graphs are translated into Csound gen functions
and are stored at the top of the score.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Cecilia grapher is designed
to provide easy entry of break-point functions. The composer can
draw line segments on a two-dimension graph scaling values over
a time specified for the duration of the score or by using the
function directly in a table or an oscillator. A library of preset
functions is provided with buttons and full parametric control:random,
brownian, scatter and many periodic waveforms. Graphs can be cut,
copied, pasted, compressed, expanded and shifted arbitrarily.
Any number of graphs can be used in a module.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At compute time, Cecilia graph
functions are compiled into the Csound score and read by their
own automatically assigned instrument in the orchestra. All graphic
functions are read in instrument no. 199 with oscil1i opcodes.
When computation is launched, functions described in the grapher
window are compiled into individual ftables and inserted in the
score using a gen05 (exponential), gen07 (linear) or gen08 (spline)
method with the desired function number. A note is inserted in
the score with start-time 0 on i199 with a duration obtained from
a Cecilia &quot;total_time&quot; slider or the duration of the
longest input soundfile chosen with a Cecilia file input object.
The values are passed on to the user orchestra via global variables
bearing the same name as the source function with the &quot;gk&quot;
prefix. All these assignments are done automatically and are not
usually visible to the user.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The declaration for a graphing
function is given in the interface window pane of the editor using
the following syntax:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">cec_graph</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Courier New">
name unit log|lin min_value max_value start_value Func#</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2- Real-time Objects<BR>
</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><IMG SRC="figures/04.jpg" WIDTH="492"
HEIGHT="349" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Fig.
4</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">
Real-time objects pass data to a running computation through console-driven
events.<BR>
Gestures on the sliders can be captured, saved and recalled through
the menu accompanying each slider.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cecilia real-time objects provide
real-time interaction with the orchestra by opening a pipe to
the Csound computation and formatting console-driven events to
update the value of their associated variable. Objects are arranged
in their own window in the order they are declared in the interface
pane of the editor. Sliders, pop-up menus and toggle switches
are provided. Further to providing real-time interaction, each
real-time object offers a menu by which gestures on individual
objects can be recorded, saved, recalled and played back.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Real-time interaction is accomplished
by using the Csound console-event mechanism. A movement on the
slider will generate a formatted line-event piped to the current
Csound process. At compile time, each slider used in the interface
is assigned two unique instruments. One will simply read the piped
in data from the Cecilia kernel and broadcast the current value
to the orchestra through a global variable. The other instrument
will handle the recording and playback of gestures on this specific
object according to the function selected with its menu. No data
is read in from an object if it is in playback mode.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Ranges and names of each object,
along with orientation and increment are specified in the interface
section of the Cecilia editor. Objects will appear in the order
declared within the area reserved for their type. The following
syntax is used:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">cec_slider</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Courier New">
name unit orient(v|h) inc min_value max_value default_val<BR>
<I>cec_toggle</I> name unit default_val<BR>
<I>cec_popup</I> name unit list_of_values</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Handling Scores</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As stated earlier, Csound provides
only rudimentary tools for generating and editing scores. For
simple, or even complex sound processing functions, this may not
be a major stumbling block since scores will often consist of
a single note used to start a given process process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">For more score-oriented tasks,
a number of score descriptor languages are available. Cscore and
Scot are useful and come prepackaged in the Csound distribution,
but the composer should be allowed, within the same environment
to use any score generating program. This task is somewhat facilitated
by the fact that all score-generating software will end up generating
a note list that will be passed to Csound for computation. Hence,
Cecilia offers an integrated environment where any program can
be used. In its standard usage, Cecilia always generates temporary
files for computation. It is therefore easy to configure Cecilia
to call any program to generate the actual note list.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A keyword at the beginning of
the score definition in the score pane of the editor defines the
program to call for generating the note list and the syntax that
is used in the statements that follow. In the absence of a keyword,
the following score is taken to be a regular Csound note list
that will be passed directly for computation. Note that any function
definitions can precede the score syntax declaration. Also, any
function definitions issuing from the Cecilia graphing tablet
are automatically inserted at the beginning of the final note
list.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Midifiles are automatically recognised
when opened with the editor file browser and the proper flags
and files are passed on to Csound at computation time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the Cecilia score editor, the
following keywords can be used:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#min (minimum)</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This call will generate a score
consisting of a single event with a start time of 0 and a duration
specified by either a value taken from a Cecilia slider specifically
named &quot;total_duration&quot; or from the length in seconds
of the longest input soundfile declared through a Cecilia <I>filein</I>
object.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#Cscore</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The statements following are taken
to be a C program. The C compiler is called with the data to obtain
the executable. The resulting program is then executed and the
generated note list is passed on to a temporary score file that
will be be compiled with the current orchestra.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#Cm</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Launches the Lisp kernel with
the text describing all algorithms following the keyword. A script
is written and passed to Stella. The script loads the score file
into Stella and a write command is executed within Stella to produce
an Csound formatted note list. The Csound computation is then
launched with the produced document. Note that, in the current
implementation, Common Music is run in &quot;batch&quot; mode,
meaning that much of the interaction normally available within
the lisp kernel in a Common Music session is lost. Future versions
will support full lisp interactivity.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#Tcl</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The statements following are taken
to be a tcl program. Any tcl program is executed within the Cecilia
kernel and a note list is returned. It is up to the user to ensure
proper output.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#Scot</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The statements following are taken
to be in Scot format. All necessary interface functions are pasted
at the top of the file and the Csound computation is called with
the -S flag.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Courier New">#Cyb</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The statements following are taken
to be in Cybil format. Cybil is a score generating language that
is a superset of tcl commands and built into the Cecilia kernel.
Its main goal is to facilitate the generation of score fragments.
The syntax is simple and meant to be easily memorised. Cybil owes
some of its functionalities and syntax to Leland Smith's SCORE
language and, to a lesser extent, to Common Music.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">More About Cybil</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cybil is a language built in tcl
and is an integral part of the Cecilia environment. Scores are
defined by listing commands on a per-parameter basis. A short
example:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">&lt;Csound score header&gt;<BR>
instr 1<BR>
p2 {sq .1 60s};<BR>
p3 {sq 2 60s}* {pa 2};<BR>
p4 {sq {ran i 100 900}60s};<BR>
p5 {lo f 40 90 60s};<BR>
e</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">would produce a score of 600 notes
(0.1 sec for 60seconds) where the duration of each note would
be 0.2 seconds (p2 * 2). The pitch (p4) of each note would be
a random integer value between 100 and 900. The amplitude (p5)
would rise logarithmically from 40 to 90.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cybil General Syntax</FONT></H3>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. A Cybil score starts with
  the #cyb keyword.<BR>
  2. The score proper starts at the first instrument definition
  keyword:<I>instr</I> followed by the instrument number(s) it
  applies to.<BR>
  3. Each instrument definition ends with &quot;e&quot; on a separate
  line.<BR>
  4. A Cybil score can contain any number of instrument definitions.<BR>
  5. Parameter data is entered on any number of lines terminated
  by a &quot;;&quot; the first line being p2 the second p3, etc.<BR>
  6. A parameter line can contain any number of Cybil commands.<BR>
  7. A command consists of an algorithm optionally followed by
  an operator and a function.</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A Cybil command generates data
over a given number of events or a given period of time, according
to a specific algorithm. The general syntax is:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">{algorithm duration}[ operator {function}]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Each algorithm is entered between
the &quot;{}&quot; brackets. A space separates each successive
command. The operator and function are an optional part of the
command. If present the results of the command will be operated
on by the given function. Duration can be specified in two ways:
A single number indicates the command will be in function for
a number of events. A single number followed immediately with
a <I>s</I> indicates the command will be in function for a number
of seconds.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cybil Algorithms:</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">sq {sq val1 val2 val3....dur(s)} ;
a data sequencer<BR>
li {li min max dur(s)} ; a linear progression<BR>
lo {lo min max du(s)} ; a logarithmic progression<BR>
ma {ma f/i min1 min2 max1 max2 dur(s)} ; a tendency mask<BR>
gr {gr name_of_graph dur(s)} ; a mapping from a Cecilia graph
function</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cybil Functions:</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A Cybil function generates one
value each time it is called. Functions cannot be used to generate
multiple pieces of data. To do this, they must be embedded into
an algorithm. The Cybil functions are:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">ran {ran f/i min max} ; random number
in floating point or integer<BR>
pik {pik val1 val2 val3 val3 ..} ; a random pick amongst a set
of values<BR>
pa {pa #} ; a time-stamped value from another parameter<BR>
co {co #} ; a constant<BR>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In most cases, any value in an
algorithm can be replaced by a function. The <I>sq</I> algorithm
can contain other algorithms as values such as other sequences.
The level of nesting is arbitrary. One of the most interesting
algorithm in Cybil is <I>gr</I> . This command allows the mapping
of any current Cecilia graph onto any parameter. Values are mapped
linearly over a given time period meaning that a given graph can
be mapped in different time periods during the same score and
over different parameters.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Conclusion</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cecilia's main mandate is to optimize
the production of sound and music. As such, it has given access
to the rich possibilities of Csound to many who would perhaps
not have ventured into it. In the time it has been available since
1996, Cecilia has led to the creation of more than three dozen
substantial electroacoustic pieces at the Universit&eacute; de
Montreal, a majority of which were by young composers who had
not yet learned Csound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Perhaps the most significant contribution
of this interface was to tame and manage complex work sessions
with Csound and allowing very quick turnaround for experimentation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Version 2.0 of Cecilia is already
well under way and will feature an entirely new object-oriented
interface with multiple orchestra and score editing along with
a piano-roll type interface for composition.</FONT>
