VMCI Plus is fully configurable and provides a total control of MIDI messages, even without any MIDI interface card and without any external MIDI keyboard or controller. This program is primarily designed to control real-time versions of Csound (DirectCsound in particular), &nbsp;however it can also be used with any internal or external MIDI device or computer programs such as sequencers. It provides several panels with virtual sliders, virtual joysticks and virtual piano-keyboard. The newer version of the program (VMCI Plus 2) allows to change more than one parameter at the same time by means of the new Hyper-Vectorial Synthesis control. VMCI supports 7-bit data as well as the higher resolution 14-bit data that can be handled by the newer versions of Csound.</p>		<h4>VMCI Plus requirements:</h4>		<ul>			<li>Windows 95 or NT.<br>			<li>800x600 monitor resolution or higher (You can also use 640x480, but some windows might not displayed entirely). 1024x768 pixels are recommended to work comfortably with VMCI Plus.<br>			<li>Though DirectCsound is optional (you can use VMCI also together with other programs such as sequencers etc.), the best of VMCI is reached when it is used together with DirectCsound itself. So be sure to have DirectCsound installed in your computer.<br>			<li>A virtual midi Loopback device such as HUBI'S Midi Loopback, included in the package (thanks to Hubert Winkler). It is optional if you intend to control only external hardware MIDI instruments, but required when using Csound or sequencers.<br>			<li>A fast computer&nbsp;(when DirectCsound is used at the same time in real-time; Pentium II or higher processors are recommended).		</ul>		<h4>VMCI Plus features:</h4>		<ol>			<li>An arbitrary number of completely configurable&nbsp;<i><b>7-bit slider panels</b></i>. Each panel can handle up to 2048 controllers (16 MIDI channel X 128 controllers = 2048). The user can modify each controller by means of a slider. &nbsp;When moving a slider, a stream of MIDI control change messages are sent to the MIDI out port, according to slider position. Most sliders are hidden from current view, because a maximum of 64 sliders can be visualized at the same time in each panel (assuming the screen resolution is big enough). The user The number of visualized sliders can be adjusted by the user for each panel.<br>			<li>An arbitrary number of completely configurable <i><b>14-bit slider</b></i> <i><b>panels</b></i>. Each panel can handle up to 1024 parameter. Similar to 7-bit slider panels, but offers a double data resolution. Each parameter is handled by means of two controllers, the first handling the most significant data byte, the second the less significant one. Up to 32 sliders can be visualized at the same time in each panel (assuming the screen resolution is big enough). The number of visualized sliders can be adjusted by the user for each panel.<br>			<li>An arbitrary number of <i><b>7-bit virtual joystick</b></i> (mouse-sensitive areas) panels. It is possible to modify two parameter at the same time by dragging the mouse pointer inside a mouse-sensitive area. These areas are similar to the 'xyin' opcode of Csound. Each panel can handle up to 2048 controllers. Up to 10 joystick areas can be visualized at the same time in each panel,&nbsp;handling 20 controllers. The number of visualized joystick areas can be adjusted by the user, for each panel.<br>			<li>An arbitrary number of <i><b>14-bit virtual joystick</b></i> (mouse-sensitive areas) panels. &nbsp;Each panel can handle up to 1024 parameters. Similar to 7-bit joystick panels, but offers a double data resolution. Each panel can visualize up to 2 areas a time, handling 4 parameters. The number of visualized joystick areas can be adjusted by the user for each panel.<br>			<li>Each slider panel can be instantly converted into a virtual joystick panel and vice-versa, preserving all current parameter values and positions.<br>			<li>Each slider (or joystick) of a panel can be moved not only by the mouse, but also by incoming MIDI control-change messages. This allows remote control of sliders (joysticks). The assignments of each remote MIDI message can be freely configured by the user.<br>			<li><i><b>Snapshots</b></i>. All the slider (joystick) positions of each panel can be stored into a '<i>snapshot</i>'. Up to 128 snapshots can be created in each panel. Each one of these snapshots can be instantly recalled by pushing a button. &nbsp;When a snapshot is recalled, all slider positions are updated according to the corresponding snapshot content, and all MIDI control-change messages, corresponding to the new slider positions, are sent to the MIDI OUT port. Each snapshot can be also associated to an incoming MIDI note-on or program-change message, in order to allow remote recalling of any snapshot, belonging to any panel.<br>			<li><i><b>HVS</b></i> <i><b>(Hyper Vectorial Synthesis)</b></i>. VMCI Plus allows to modify hundreds of parameters with a single mouse motion, according to a structure configured by the user. This control method is called <i>Hyper Vectorial Synthesis Control </i>(see below). Each slider/joystick panel has an HVS&nbsp;panel associated to it. In each HVS panel there are two HVS areas: a one-dimensional area and a two-dimensional one. Normally the user interacts with these areas with the mouse, however a remote MIDI control is possible, by assigning the pointer motion inside each area to one or more incoming MIDI control-change messages.<br>			<li><i><b>Virtual Keyboard</b></i>. This keyboard looks piano-like, but each button can be reconfigured in order to send any &nbsp;kind of MIDI messages. The buttons can also activate a snapshot belonging to any slider/joystick panel. Each button can be associated to a key of the alphanumeric keyboard, as well as to an incoming MIDI message, allowing remote control of events joined with each button.<br>		</ol>		<h4>		<hr size="10">		</h4>		<h2><a name="how"></a><!-- -->		<a name="install"></a><!-- -->		<font color="navy">How to install VMCI</font> <font color="navy">Plus</font></h2>		<p>To install MSVC you must follow the next steps:</p>		<ol>			<li>Download the zipped archive containing the program at the following url:<br>			<br>			http://www.tiscalinet.it/G-Maldonado<br>			<br>			Create a folder named &quot;c:\csound\&quot; and unzip the archive in that directory, preserving the directory structure.<br>			<li>Create a shortcut of the executable file (VMCI Plus.exe) in the desktop and/or in the start menu in order to make it faster to start it.		</ol>		<p>Here is the installation procedure to use VMCI Plus with DirectCsound:<br>		</p>		<ol>			<li>If DirectX (version 5.0 or higher) is not already present on your computer, then download and Install Microsoft DirectX package.

When VMCI starts, the <i><b>activation bar</b></i> appears (after a splash screen is closed).<br>		The activation bar is the main window of VMCI, it can be used to accomplish the following tasks:<br>		</p>		<ul>			<li><b>Opening</b> and <b>saving</b> a <b>custom setup file</b><br>			<img src="LoadSave.jpg"><br>			Click to the load/save icons or select the corresponding commands in &quot;<i>File</i>&quot; menu.&nbsp;These files have <i><b>'.stp2' </b></i>extension and contain the configuration of current state of VMCI Plus (panels, various settings etc.). &nbsp;You can also drag an '.stp2' &nbsp;file on the Activation Bar to load it.<br>			You can also associate an '.stp2' file to &nbsp;the 'vmci.exe' executable, so you can open an '.stp2' file by simply double-clicking to it.<br>			<li><b>Creating</b> and <b>destroying</b> <b>slider/joystick panels</b><br>			<img src="AddRemove.jpg" width="275" height="66"><br>			It is possible to create a new panel by clicking the corresponding button. It is possible to remove last created panel by clicking to the &quot;Delete last panel&quot; button. When a new panel is being created, the user is prompted to type a name for that panel. Then a the new panel window appears, and a check-box appears in the &quot;show/hide panels&quot; area of the activation bar (see next topic).<br>			Notice that you can add a clone of an existing panel (i.e. a new panel containing all current panel settings and controller positions) by selecting the menu <b>Edit / Add a clone of an existing panel...</b><br>			<li><b>Showing</b> and <b>hiding</b> <b>slider/joystick panels</b><br>			<img src="ShowHide.jpg" width="275" height="106"><br>			Each time a new panel is created, a new check box will appear in this area. If you click one these check boxes you will show/hide the corresponding panel.

Useful when naming a lot of snapshots.		</ul>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<h2><a name="7bitS"></a><!-- -->		<font color="navy">7-bit Slider Panels</font></h2>		<p><img src="7bitSlider.jpg" width="600" height="183"></p>		<p><b>7-bit Slider Panels</b> can visualize up to 64 sliders (only 8 sliders are visualized in the picture).</p>		<p>Normally visible sliders are only a subset of the total number of control parameters that can be handled by a single slider panel. Acutally 7-bit slider panels can handle <u>up to 2048 different parameters</u> (that is the total number of MIDI control change messages: 16 channels X 128 controllers = 2048 parameters). See <a href="#PanelConf"><b>panel configuration dialog-box</b></a> to learn&nbsp;how setting-up&nbsp;the total number of control parameters and the number of visible sliders of a panel.</p>		<p>When a slider is moved, a stream of MIDI messages is sent to the current MIDI OUT port (these MIDI messages are <i>control-change</i> messages, those with the status-byte $B0 + channel-number. The second byte of a MIDI control-change message is the controller number. Some famous MIDI control-change numbers are number 1-Modulation Wheel, 2-Breath Control, 7-Volume, 10-Pan, 64-Damper Pedal, etc. The third byte of a MIDI control-change message is the datum itself, expressed within a 0 to 127 range). Some Csound opcodes can convert incoming midi raw data into a floating-point number within a min-max range defined by the user; so VMCI shows current slider value in two ways: midi-raw-data and floating-point-translated data. The min-max range&nbsp;can be different for each slider. The default range is 0 to 1, but can be changed by the user (negative numbers are allowed too).<br>		<br>		Near each slider some information is displayed. <img src="slid.jpg" width="573" height="16"><br>		Starting from the left:</p>		<ul>			<li>the blue number at the left of each slider shows slider order number;			<li>the black number at the left of each slider shows the raw MIDI data value corresponding to current slider position;			<li>the blue number at the right of each slider shows the floating-point value, scaled according the min-max settings of each slider;			<li>the red number at the right of each slider shows the control number of the outgoing MIDI control-change message, sent when slider is moved. By &nbsp;default, the first 128 numbers are the same of the slider order number, but they can be freely modified by the user;			<li>the white number on black background at the right of each slider shows the MIDI channel assigned to the outgoing MIDI messages, sent when slider is moved. Can be freely modified by the user, individually for each slider;			<li>the text string at the right of each slider is a comment defined by the user in order to quickly remember the meaning of the corresponding parameter.		</ul>		<p>All comments, as well as all current slider positions and other user-modified parameters, are stored to disk when current VMCI setup is saved.</p>		<p>Notice that, when you resize this panel horizontally, all visualized sliders are redrawn with a new length, to match the new size. This feature is useful to obtain a more precise control with the mouse: in this case, resizing the panel, filling the maximum area possible with current screen setting, will provide a more precise mouse motion control.</p>		<p>Above the sliders there is an area containing several buttons, text boxes and a combo box. This area is called <i><b>button-bar</b></i>. If you click one of the sliders, some information will appear&nbsp;immediately in the first three text boxes. These text boxes contain:<br>		</p>		<ol>			<li>MIDI control-change number,			<li>MIDI channel,			<li>floating-point min-max scaled value of last clicked slider (i.e. the slider which has got the focus).		</ol>		<p>The first two text boxes can be edited and the modifications ar automatically applied to the configuration of the corresponding slider. Notice that, when you change the controller number or the MIDI channel of a slider, that numbers will appear near the slider itself (the red and white numbers at the right of each slider). The third text box duplicates the floating-point translated data value of current slider and, being a text-box, the corresponding string can be selected, copied and pasted to a csound orchestra or score.&nbsp;Sometimes this can be useful to interactively define Csound parameters in orchestras or scores.</p>		<p>A description of the other features of the <i>button-bar</i> follows:</p>		<ul>			<li>The <img src="ValuesList.jpg" width="65" height="20"> button, when clicked,&nbsp;adds the current floating-point-translated values of the 64 slider positions &nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the comments of each slider&nbsp;to the CopyBoard, a window that can be used as notepad you can copy text from to paste to another application.			<li>The <img src="CCinstrCall.jpg" width="100" height="19">&nbsp;button does almost the same thing of the previous one, but this time the text added to the CopyBoard is intended to be pasted to a Csound orchestra, because it is formatted for the &quot;slider64&quot; opcode (If you don't use Csound, you mustn't be worried about it)			<li>The <img src="P-fields.jpg" width="48" height="19">&nbsp;button does almost the same thing of the previous one, but &nbsp;the text it adds to the CopyBoard is intended to be pasted to an i-statement of a Csound score. Each value represent a p-field.			<li>The <img src="sendCC.jpg" width="128" height="41">&nbsp;button, when clicked, sends all the midi messages corresponding to the current positions of the sliders at a time. It is very useful to reconstruct the internal state of a midi instrument when an old configuration file is just loaded. This allows to use VMCI as a synth patch editor with Csound or other synthesizers capable to relate MIDI control messages to their internal state parameters. You can save the patch (i.e. the positions of all sliders) to disk and then reload and send it to a running instance of Csound or to another MIDI instrument.			<li>The &nbsp;<b>Csound buttons</b><br>			(<img src="CSettings.jpg" width="303" height="35">)<br>			have the same purpose of those placed in the activation bar. Refer to the previous discussion.			<li>The <img src="activateNote.jpg" width="63" height="67"> button activates/deactivates a note by sending MIDI note-on/off messages. In order to configure the note number, channel and velocity of this note, you have to open the panel configuration dialog box (see next topic).			<li>The <b>panel configuration</b> button<br>			(<img src="panConfig.jpg" width="74" height="67">)<br>			shows/hides a dialog box. The purpose of this dialog box is to configure several settings referred to current panel. See <a href="#PanelConf"><b>Panel configuration Dialog Box</b></a> for more information.			<li>The <b>HVS</b> button<br>			(<img src="HVSbutt.jpg" width="84" height="67">)<br>			shows/hides the <i>Hyper Vectorial Synthesis Panel</i>. This is a panel that allows the user a powerful control of many parameters at the same times, with a single mouse movement. See<b>&nbsp;<a href="#HVS">Hyper Vectorial Synthesis Panel </a></b>for more information.<br>			<li>The <b>&quot;snapshots&quot; area</b><br>			(<img src="snapshot.jpg" width="183" height="85">)<br>			allows to store, recall, create and delete snapshots. A snapshot is <u>a set of synthesis parameter values</u> to&nbsp;be sent via MIDI. Snapshots appear as buttons labeled with a number, placed in this area. Each snapshot contains all states of visualized and hidden controllers of a panel. When a snapshot button is clicked, the positions of all visible sliders are automatically updated according to the snapshot content. Besides, all corresponding MIDI control-change messages are sent to the MIDI out port. Notice that MIDI messages of controllers hidden to view <u>are sent too</u>. So it is possible to instantly switch&nbsp;from a sonic configuration to&nbsp;another by means of a simple mouse click.<br>			Also, there are three other ways to activate a snapshot:			<ol>				<li>by selecting its name in the snapshot combo-box (see below).				<li>by pressing a key in the alphanumeric keyboard, in case a snapshot is configured to be activated by this kind of action;				<li>by sending a MIDI note on message to the VMCI MIDI input port, in case a snapshot is configured to be activated by this kind of events.			</ol>			<p>See <a href="#the keyboard panel"><b>Virtual Keyboard Panel</b></a>&nbsp;for more information about remote activation of snapshots (topic 2 and 3 of previous numbered list), and how to configure it.<br>			<br>			<b>Creating snapshots</b><br>			When a slider panel is just created, no snapshots are present, so the snapshot area appears like this:<br>			<img src="snap2.jpg" width="150" height="67">.<br>			Notice that only a button without any label appears inside the snapshot area. In order to create a snapshot follow these steps:</p>			<ol>				<li>set all sliders in the wanted positions;				<li><b>shift-click </b>the unlabeled button.			</ol>			<p>Notice that a new button, labeled with &quot;0&quot; will appear in the location of the unlabeled button, and the unlabeled button position is shifted down:<br>			<img src="snap3.jpg" width="150" height="67">.<br>			If you continue to shift-click the unlabeled button you will continue creating other new snapshots. Up to 128 snapshot can be created (with a resolution of 1024x768, at least). If your screen resolution is lower than 1024x768, probably a lower number of snapshots will be accessible.<br>			<br>			<b>Recalling snapshots</b><br>			To recall a snapshot, simply <b>click</b> onto the corresponding button in the snapshot area. You will notice that all slider positions will be moved according to the snapshot content. Also all MIDI control-change messages corresponding to&nbsp;visible and hidden slider are sent to the output port. (Actually, a MIDI bandwidth optimizing algorithm is implemented, so, if a slider has the same value of a message previously sent to the MIDI out port, that&nbsp;message is skipped).<br>			<br>			<b>Updating existing snapshots</b><br>			To update an existing snapshot with a new slider configuration, <b>shift-click</b> the corresponding button. All parameters will be updated according to current slider positions.<br>			<br>			<b>Deleting snapshots</b><br>			To delete <i>last created snapshot</i>, <b>control-click</b> the unlabeled button in the snapshot area. Notice that only the snapshot with the highest number can be deleted. However you can delete iteratively any number of existing snapshot.<br>			<br>			<b>Naming/renaming snapshots</b><br>			Snapshots have a unique progressive number that appears in the caption of corresponding button. However they also can have a string in order to allow the user to easily locate them. The string appears as a tool-tip text when the mouse pointer remains over a snapshot button for some seconds.<br>			There are two method to name/rename snapshots. The first method is to <b>ALT-click </b>the snapshot button; a dialog box will ask the user to type the snapshot name and press the OK button. The second method will be explained in next topic.<br>			</p>			<li>The <b>snapshot combo-box</b> (<img src="snapCombo.jpg" width="301" height="26">) accomplishes the following tasks:			<ul>				<li>displays the name of currently selected snapshot,				<li>can alternatively select another snapshot by expanding the list and clicking on a new name,				<li>allows to rename currently selected snapshot (second method).			</ul>			<p>Renaming snapshot with the combo box can be made faster by setting the &quot;<i>Rename snapshots straightaway</i>&quot; check-box (placed in the activation bar) checked. In this case it is not necessary to change the focus from last clicked snapshot button to the snapshot combo-box, but it is possible to type the text directly, after clicking the button itself.</p>		</ul>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<h2><a name="14bitS"></a><!-- -->		<font color="navy">14-bit Slider Panels</font></h2>		<p><img src="14bitSlider.jpg" width="600" height="266"></p>		<p>These sliders allow a higher precision when using Csound's '<i>midic14</i>' , '<i>ctrl14</i>' and '<i>sliderXXb14</i>' opcodes. The higher resolution is provided by combining two different MIDI controller messages for each slider, one for the first seven bits (Most Significant Byte) and the other for the last seven bits (Less Significant Byte). So a fourteen-bit number is generated, supporting of a range of &nbsp;0 to 16383 vs. the 0-127 range of the seven-bit sliders. To obtain a real resolution improvement, the number of pixels scanned by the mouse movement (when moving a slider) must be greater than 128. For this reason it is recommended to resize horizontally the 14-bit slider panel, setting it to the maximum width allowed by your screen resolution.</p>		<p>The 14-bit slider panels are &nbsp;very similar to the 7-bit ones. A description of each difference is presented below.</p>		<ul>			<li>The maximum number of visible sliders is 32 per panel (64 in the case of 7-bit slider panels) even if the total number (considering slider hidden to view) is 1024 (2048 in the case of 7-bit slider panels).<br>			<li>There are two pairs of controller-channel text-boxes associated to each slider <img src="cc14text.jpg" width="119" height="38">, the first refers to the Most Significant Byte and the second to the Less Significant Byte.			<li>There are two pairs of controller/channel labels near each slider referring to the MSB and LSB <img src="ct14.jpg" width="198" height="16">, as well as a new displacement for raw data values (black text) and min-max scaled data values (blue text) .			<li>A different displacement of the text string comments is provided, in order to maximize the length of each slider.		</ul>		<h2>		<hr>		<a name="7bitJ"></a><!-- -->		<font color="navy">7-bit Joystick Panels</font></h2>		<p><img src="7bitJoy.jpg" width="550" height="411"></p>		<p>These panels contain 10 mouse-sensitive areas. When the right mouse button is pressed over one of these 10 areas, two MIDI control-change messages are sent, the first corresponding to&nbsp;the horizontal position, the other to the vertical one. So it is possible to control two different parameter at a time with a single mouse movement. When you drag the mouse into a mouse-sensitive area,&nbsp;a stream of control values will be sent to the midi-out port. This behavior is similar to '<i>xyin</i>' opcode of Csound. A total of 20 controllers are visible in each panel, however the total control numbers available is 2048 as in the case of 7-bit sliders.</p>		<p>The toolbar &nbsp;of these panels is similar to that of &nbsp;7-bit slider and 14-bit slider panels. The differences are:</p>		<ul>			<li>The comment text-boxes are two instead of one, because each area sends the values of two different parameters a time (X and Y axis).<br>			<img src="7bitJoyComment.jpg" width="161" height="76">			<li>There are two pairs of controller/channel labels near each area referring to the horizontal (X) and vertical axis (Y) and there is a new displacement for raw data values (black text) and min-max scaled floating-point data values (blue text) .<br>			<li>The <i><b>Panel Configuration Dialog Box </b></i>is a little different.

The higher resolution is provided by combining two different MIDI controller messages for each slider, one for the first seven bits (Most Significant Byte) and the other for the last seven bits (Less Significant Byte). So a fourteen-bit number is generated, supporting of a range of &nbsp;0 to 16383 vs. the 0-127 range of the seven-bit sliders. To obtain a real resolution improvement, the number of pixels scanned by the mouse movement (when dragging mouse inside a joystick area) must be greater than 128. For this reason it is recommended to resize both horizontally and vertically the 14-bit joystick panel, setting it to the maximum dimension allowed by your screen resolution.</p>		<p>The 14-bit joystick panels are very similar to the 7-bit ones. A description of each difference is presented below.</p>		<ul>			<li>The maximum number of visible mouse-sensitive areas is 2 per panel (10 in the case of 7-bit joystick panels) even if the total number (considering slider hidden to view) is 1024 (2048 in the case of 7-bit joystick panels). The reason of this small number is to increase the dimension of each joystick area in order to improve mouse motion resolution.<br>			<li>When resizing the 14-bit panel window, the mouse-sensitive areas are resized too, in order to take advantage of all screen space available. 7-bit mouse-sensitive area sizes are fixed instead.<br>			<li>There are four pairs of controller-channel text-boxes associated to each slider (<img src="j14text.jpg" width="234" height="42">), the first refers to the Most Significant Byte of X axis the second to the Less Significant Byte of X axis, the third to the Most Significant Byte of Y axis, the fourth to the Less Significant Byte of Y axis.<br>			<li>There are four pairs of controller/channel labels near each slider referring to the MSB and LSB of horizontal and vertical axes.

Each slider/joystick panel is the <i><b>parent</b></i> of a Hyper-Vectorial Synthesis panel connected to itself, which&nbsp;can be shown/hidden by clicking the &quot;<i><b>View HVS panel</b></i>&quot; button.<br>		Hyper-vectorial synthesis panels allow the user to vary many parameters at the same time, with a single mouse movement. See the <a href="../index.html#HVS"><b>Introduction</b></a> section for more theoretical information about Hyper Vectorial Synthesis.</p>		<p>HVS panel has two mouse-sensitive areas:<br>		a one-dimensional area (see picture below):<br>		<img src="1dim.jpg" width="300" height="30"></p>		<p>...and a two-dimensional area (see picture below):<br>		<img src="2dim.jpg" width="150" height="116"></p>		<p>During a performance, the user interacts with this panel by dragging the mouse inside one of mouse-sensitive areas.<br>		Also, a MIDI remote control to move the cursor of each areas is provided (see <a href="#PanelConf"><b>Panel Configuration Dialog Box</b></a>).</p>		<p>Each button inside mouse-sensitive areas represents a <i><b>breakpoint</b></i>. A breakpoint (as a snapshot) is a set of values of different synthesis parameters.<br>		Each breakpoint <u>must be linked to a previously created snapshot</u>. Notice that the snapshot area is present also in HVS panel; snapshots buttons of this area are simply shortcuts to the snapshots of the parent slider/joystick panel.<br>		In order to link a breakpoint to a snapshot, click the breakpoint button, a dialog box appears asking to type the snapshot number to link to, then type the number and click OK.&nbsp;As a faster&nbsp;alternative, drag the snapshot button with the right mouse button over the breakpoint button to link, then drop it.</p>		<p>At first, the user has to decide how many breakpoints he needs both for the one-dimensional area and the two-dimensional one. To set these numbers it is necessary to open the HVS configuration panel by clicking the <img src="hvsConfig.jpg" width="50" height="54">button. The following dialog-box will appear:<br>		<img src="hvsConfigPanel.jpg" width="250" height="340"></p>		<p>To add a breakpoint in the one-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Add point</b>&quot; button; to remove leftmost breakpoint of the one-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Remove point</b>&quot; button. Notice that at least two breakpoints must be present in the one-dimensional area. Actually when the HVS panel is first opened, its one-dimensional area contains two breakpoints.</p>		<p>The two-dimensional area consist of rows and columns of breakpoints, and at least two breakpoints must be present in each row and in each column. Consequently the minimum number of breakpoints allowed in two-dimensional area is four. Actually when the HVS panel is first opened, its two-dimensional area contains four breakpoints.<br>		To add a row of breakpoints in the two-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Add X Line of points</b>&quot; button; to remove a row of the one-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Remove X Line</b>&quot; button.<br>		To add a column of breakpoints in the two-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Add Y Line of points</b>&quot; button; to remove a column of breakpoints in the one-dimensional area, click the &quot;<b>Remove Y Line</b>&quot; button.</p>		<p>Notice that you can hide all breakpoint buttons by unchecking the &quot;<b>view buttons</b>&quot; check-box.</p>		<p>Also you can hide the parent slider/joystick panel by unchecking the &quot;<b>show/hide parent panel</b>&quot; check-box.</p>		<p>You can also assign an incoming MIDI message to the pointer motion of one-dimensional and two-dimensional HVS areas, in order to obtain a remote control of Hyper-vectorial synthesis. To do that you can configure the messages of the <b>&quot;Incoming MIDI messages&quot; </b>grid<b>. </b>This grid is identical to that of &nbsp;the Panel configuration dialog box. See <a href="#PanelConf"><b>Panel configuration dialog box</b></a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>		<p>Moving the mouse around the HVS areas will change all parameters stored in the adjacent breakpoints, by linearly interpolating their values according to the mouse position.

A click on a piano-key-like push-button can send a note-on/off, a program-change or a pitch-bend message to the MIDI out port . The user can configure each key to send the type of message he needs; any type of &nbsp;MIDI VOICE messages can be assigned to each piano-like &nbsp;button.<br>		Also it is possible to assign a computer key to a piano-like button so you can play the computer keyboard in the manner of a piano keyboard. A total of 959 MIDI messages can be stored in memory.<br>		Furthermore remote control is possible by means of incoming MIDI note-on or program-change messages. All these messages are completely configurable by the user.<br>		Besides, snapshots belonging to any slider/joystick panel can be associated to each piano-like button. In this case each snapshot can be activated both by computer alphanumeric keyboard and by a remote MIDI keyboard sending messages to VMCI. The snapshot assignment is totally configurable.</p>		<p>An explanation of&nbsp;each Virtual Keyboard feature follows.</p>		<p>When you open the virtual keyboard panel for the first time, it is set to a default configuration. All of the piano-like buttons are set to send MIDI note-on/off messages, so you can play these buttons as they would be the keys of a piano. However you can totally edit this configuration.</p>		<p>There are three modes to operate with the Virtual Keyboard panel:</p>		<ol>			<li><i><b>play mode</b></i>			<li><i><b>edit mode</b></i>			<li><i><b>show mode</b></i>		</ol>		<p>see also the radio buttons in the picture below:</p>		<p><img src="keyModes.jpg" width="103" height="66"></p>		<p>You can switch to any of these three modes by clicking the corresponding radio-button.</p>		<p>In <i><b>play</b></i> <i><b>mode</b></i> you can play the notes, trigger the MIDI messages and/or recall snapshots Virtual Keyboard is configured with.<br>		In <i><b>edit</b></i> <i><b>mode</b></i> you can change the type and the data of the MIDI message associated with each piano-like button. Also you can assign each&nbsp;piano-like button to&nbsp;any computer key. In edit mode you can also assign an incoming MIDI note-on or program-change message to a piano-like button, in order to allow remote control of each button of the virtual keyboard.<br>		In <i><b>show</b></i> <i><b>mode</b></i> you can view the parameters (message type, message data and the computer key assigned to that button) assigned to each button.</p>		<p>Notice that snapshots can be linked to each piano-button being <u>in all three modes</u>, &nbsp;by simply <b>dragging</b> snapshot buttons of a slider/joystick panel &nbsp;with the <b>right mouse button</b>, and dropping them to any piano-like button of the virtual keyboard panel.</p>		<p>Each &nbsp;piano-like button has an <i><b>index</b></i>.<br>		Notice that <i>indexes</i> are the <u>main points of reference</u> of virtual keyboard panel configuration.<br>		</p>		<h4><a name="pmode"></a><!-- -->		Play mode</h4>		<p>To play the virtual keyboard as a piano you must set its panel to <i><b>play mode</b></i>. <i>Play mode</i> is the normal mode of the virtual keyboard panel. In this mode it is possible to click the piano-key-like&nbsp;buttons &nbsp;in order to play notes or to send some MIDI voice messages to Csound or any MIDI instrument connected to a MIDI port.<br>		Each button has an <i><b>index</b></i>, starting with zero. Indexes, not buttons, are the points of reference of each single key configuration. Notice that there are 192 piano-key-like&nbsp;buttons, but the total number of indexes available. To access to all indexes available, you can add an offset to the index reference of each piano-key-like&nbsp;button; you can do that by clicking to any of the '<i>keys to visualize</i>' &nbsp;radio-buttons (see picture below):<br>		<img src="keysToVisualize.jpg" width="122" height="108">.</p>		<p>You can also define an offset manually by typing it directly to the '<i>index offset</i>' text-box and clicking in another zone of the panel.<br>		You can play glissandos with the mouse by pressing the 'CTRL' key instead of the left mouse button as normally.<br>		You can enable/disable the sustain-pedal on all 16 midi channels by pressing/depressing the '<i><b>ALT</b></i>' key or by clicking the '<i>sustain</i>' check-box.<br>		The two vertical sliders on the right of the piano-buttons can add a global offset of the first and second data-byte of each midi-message. So if messages are note-on messages, you can change the note-number (i.e. the first data-byte of that message type) or the velocity (i.e. the second data-byte) of all keys at the same time.</p>		<h4>Edit Mode</h4>		<p>To edit a piano-key-like button, select the '<i>edit mode</i>' radio button.<br>		Then click to a piano-like button. You can see the data in the text boxes of will change (see the picture below).<br>		<img src="keyProp.jpg" width="311" height="142"><br>		Notice how the&nbsp;number inside the '<i>index</i>' text-box (that with yellow background) changes. The number you see in this text-box is the <i><b>index</b></i> number of the last piano-like button pressed. You can edit the indexes greater than 191 by clicking to any of the '<i>keys to visualize</i>' &nbsp;radio-buttons (see <a href="#pmode"><b>play mode</b></a>).&nbsp;To modify the parameters of current index,&nbsp;fill the data text boxes: you can change the MIDI channel, the first and second data byte according to your needs. Also you can choose the midi-message type you want to be assigned to that index. To do this you must select one of the midi-status-byte radio-buttons. Notice that you can also disable the present index. In this case the corresponding button will not sent any MIDI message.<br>		To test current index setting, simply click to the '<i>current message output test</i>' button (<img src="outTest.jpg" width="93" height="62">). &nbsp;<br>		<br>		You can assign a<b> computer-keyboard key </b>to current index. To do this put the focus in the '<i>key shortcut</i>' text-box and type a key on the computer keyboard. You will see an ascii value appearing inside the '<i>key shortcut</i>' text box.</p>		<p>You can assign an incoming MIDI note-on and/or program-change message to an index; in this case, when the MIDI message is recognized by VMCI, the corresponding index will be activated. To assign an incoming message you have to open the &quot;Keyboard remote MIDI configuration&quot; dialog box by clicking the corresponding button (<img src="RemoteMIDI.jpg" width="119" height="58">). To assign a message to current index you have to fill the corresponding white text boxes of &quot;Keyboard remote MIDI configuration&quot; dialog box (see below):<br>		<img src="remMIDIdia.jpg" width="301" height="100"></p>		<p>A faster way to assign a MIDI message to current index is to send it directly to the VMCI MIDI in port by means of a remote controller such as a MIDI master keyboard.</p>		<p>In order to<b> save </b>edited parameters&nbsp;of current index to memory, you have to press the '<i><b>apply values to current index</b></i>' button.<br>		There is also a faster way of saving the parameters of current index and switching to previous or next index at the same time: click one of these two buttons:<br>		<img src="saveFast.jpg" width="111" height="21">.<br>		Pressing one of these buttons both store the last edited parametrs and switch to previous/next index.</p>		<h4>Show mode</h4>		<p>The '<i>show mode</i>' is used only to view the configuration parameters of each piano-key-like&nbsp;button. In this mode, a computer-keyboard key can be pressed to see how current configuration parameters will change.</p>		<h4>		<hr>		</h4>		<h2><a name="converter"></a><!-- -->		<font color="maroon">Using VMCI converter</font></h2>		<p><img src="pict5.jpg" align="Bottom" alt="[Image]" width="318" height="151"></p>		<p><b>VMCI converter</b> is a little application provided in order&nbsp;to convert setup files created with old versions of VMCI to VMCI plus format, as VMCI Plus cannot read <b>.stp</b> files directly.&nbsp;Notice that the file extension of old setup files is <b>.stp </b>whereas the new extension is <b>.stp2</b>.</p>		<p>The use of this little program is very simple. &nbsp;To start the program, double-click the executable file icon (<b>VMCI Converter.exe</b>) &nbsp;or an eventual &nbsp;shortucut you create.
