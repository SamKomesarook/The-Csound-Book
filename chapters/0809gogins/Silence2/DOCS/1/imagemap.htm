Since Web Buddy allows you to browse web pages and sites &quot;off-line&quot;, without an Internet connection, unfortunately, server-side image maps do not work as they normally do when you are live on the web. Fortunately, server-side image maps are not as frequently used at web sites anymore.</p>		<p>		<hr align="LEFT">		</p>		<p><b>More details follow for those interested...</b></p>		<p>&nbsp;</p>		<p><b>What's an &quot;Image Map?&quot;</b></p>		<p>An image map is typically a graphic with clickable areas called links (or &quot;hyperlinks&quot;) and can take you to different sections of a Web site or to other Web sites. For example, an image of a country might allow users to click on a city or region which will then bring up information or another Web page about that place.</p>		<p><b>What's a &quot;Server-side Image Map?&quot;</b></p>		<p>An image map can be referred to as &quot;server-side&quot; or &quot;client-side.&quot; In a server-side image map, the information as to where the &quot;hot spots&quot; or hyperlinks should jump to is stored on the server. This means when you click on a &quot;hot spot,&quot; the browser asks the server what web page or URL you should be sent to next. When you are browsing a site off-line, a server cannot be contacted.</p>		<p>A client-side image map stores the information as to where the &quot;hot spots&quot; or hyperlinks should jump to right in the web page itself. This means when you click on a hot spot, the browser knows what web page or URL you should be sent to next. When you are browsing a site off-line, these will work the same way as if when you are online.</p>		<p><b>How do I tell the difference?</b></p>		<p>The best way to know whether an image map is &quot;server-side&quot; or &quot;client-side,&quot; and, therefore, know whether it will work in an off-line setting, is to glide your mouse over the image map graphic while you're still online. At the bottom of your browser, you will see where the various hot spots of the image link to. If it shows coordinate numbers, it's a &quot;server-side&quot; image map. (example: http://www.company.com/maps.cgi?101,123) If it shows full URL's, it's a &quot;client-side&quot; image map. (example: http://www.company.com/info/index.htm)	</body></html>
