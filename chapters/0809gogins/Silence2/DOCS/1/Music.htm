Not only was it composed and realized on my personal computer, by means of software alone, but it was composed using computer algorithms that I wrote. I did not use the computer to transcribe music heard in my imagination. Instead, I used the computer to produce music that I could not have imagined without the computer, and to perform music that neither I nor anybody else could have performed on any other instrument.<br>					<br>					As poor as my own efforts may be, they have completely convinced me of the enormous unexplored potential of algorithmic composition. Precisely because algorithms enable the production of material that could not have been imagined, they stimulate and amplify the imagination. The algorithms I use are based on mathematics used by scientists to describe the laws, forms, and patterns of nature. Art, said Aristotle, is the imitation of nature. In these algorithms, the imitation of nature is intrinsic to the tool: to the algorithms themselves. As a result, the knowledge encapsulated within the algorithms functions as part of the musical unconscious. This amounts to a profound interiorization of the order of the world that was never anticipated in the music of the past.</font></p>					<p><font face="Myriad Roman">Algorithmic composition on computers began in 1957 with Hiller's </font><i><font face="Myriad Roman">Iliac Suite</font></i><font face="Myriad Roman">. It has not exactly been a hit, even though other technology developed by computer musicians has revolutionalized music production with digital audio itself, frequency modulation and physical modeling synthesis, and digital signal processing. Why has algorithmic composition lagged? In the first place, computer musicians have devoted great resources to understanding and imitating traditional modes of production. This has been necessary from a </font><i><font face="Myriad Roman">technological</font></i><font face="Myriad Roman"> point of view, but in any </font><i><font face="Myriad Roman">art</font></i><font face="Myriad Roman">, imitation is a losing game. Now that computers are the basis of most music production, computer music as such is freer to explore its proper potential. Secondly, precison and beauty of sound have until recently been lacking in computer music. Now that digital audio has moved to 24-bit samples at high sampling rates, the sound quality available to computer musicians has attained parity with good recordings of live music. Thirdly, and most importantly, our civilization as a whole is much more familiar with computing, with algorithms, with fractals and chaos, and thus with the basic ideas that ground algorithmic composition.</font></p>					<p><font face="Myriad Roman">I release all of my music on this Web page in addition to making compact discs, performing in concert, seeking radio play, and so on.
