		<p>JCsound provides a Java interface to Csound, a freely available software synthesizer that is available on many computer platforms.</p>
		<p>JCsound.Csound has low-level functions that are implemented in native code by JCsound_Csound, a shared library version of Csound that is re-entrant (it can be stopped and started again without reloading).</p>
		<p>JCsound.CsoundManager provides both a graphical user interface and a higher-level programmatic interface for controlling Csound and for manipulating Csound files.</p>
		<p>JCsound.CsoundManager is used as the software synthesizer for Silence, an extensible system for making music on computers by means of software alone. JCsound can be used as a synthesizer component in other software, such as score generatoring programs. It can also run as a standalone &quot;launcher&quot; for Csound.</p>
		<h4>License</h4>
		<p>JCsound has a two part license. The Csound source code is copyright (c) 1986 and 1992 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, and is freely available for academic or research use. In practice, people have been making and selling music made with publicly available Csound for years. Contributions to Csound are generally copyrighted by their authors, but freely distributed. The Csound source code in JCsound_Csound is almost identical with John ffitch's sources, which are the canonical version of <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Man/c_front.html">public-domain Csound</a>.<br>
		<br>
		Many thanks to Professor Barry Vercoe, the original author of Csound; to Gabriel Maldonado; to Mr. ffitch; and to all the others who have contributed to this wonderful instrument over the years.<br>
