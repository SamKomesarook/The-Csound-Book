Music, society and civil rights</b></p>		<p>Rereading an old book by Frantz Fanon, &#147;Les damn&eacute;es de la terre&#148; (&#147;The Damned of the Earth&#148;), dealing with colonialism and written in 1960, I realized that things did not change so much in these 36 years. Or, they changed, but became worse. The domination of man over man, the hunger, the dead of millions of men , women, boys, girls and babies is still going on.</p>		<p>I decided to write a piece on this theme, and I collected a lot of texts by different writers, and discarded a lot of texts (among the discarded authors, Henry Thoreau, Jean Jacques Rousseau and Nazim Hikmet). So the piece uses text by Frantz Fanon (obviously), Jean Paul Sartre&#146;s introduction to &#147;Les damn&eacute;es de la terre&#148;, Marcel P&eacute;jou&#146;s article &#147;Mourir pour De Gaulle?&#148; (&#147;To die for De Gaulle?&#148;), Aim&eacute;e C&eacute;saire&#146;s &#147;Las armes miraculouses&#148; (&#147;The miracle weapons&#148;), four poems by Pablo Neruda&#146;s &#147;Canto General&#148; and a number of text by the Urugayan contemporary writer Eduardo Galeano (with whom I discuss the structure of texts).</p>		<p>The result has been a 30 minute piece for actor, soprano, C and G flute, percussion (marimbaphon, 3 cymbals, 3 tom-toms, bass drum), tape and image projection. The painter Emiliano Tolve supplied the images (some already existent, some made especially for the occasion), that were projected by means of a PC and a videoprojector, and served also as a support to the text. It was very important, to me, that the audience could understand all the text. But, since part of it is in Spanish, and part is not entirely comprehensible, I choose to project on a screen the part that might not be understood.</p>		<p>Can music express something? Can music must serve ideas? To say it with the title of an old italian opera &#147;Prima la musica e le parole poi&#148; (The Music First and the Words After)? i do not want to open a discussion here. The fact is that with &#147;I dannati della terra&#148; I intended to express my humble opinion (through the words of six writers, philosopher and poets) about a problem.</p>		<p>It was only natural that the text should be the most important part of the composition. So I chose three levels to express the text.</p>		<p>The first, the nearest to everyday language, is the spoken language of the actor (who serves as a speaker, as a &#147;master of ceremony&#148;, and has much or less the same function the choir has in Greek tragedies), and its contents approach the &#147;essay&#148;, the consciousness of who recognizes a problem, but is not personally involved in it. This first level involves the actor and a part of the voice on tape.</p>		<p>The second, the voice of the colonized peoples, is treated in a more musical way, though you cannot still speak of &#147;setting text in music&#148;: the voice sounds are treated, modified, but still comprehensible enough. This second level involves the actor and another part of the voice on tape.</p>		<p>The third, the poetical sublimation, is the nearest to &#147;music&#148; in its common sense. The four &#147;songs&#148; of the soprano on texts by Neruda, in fact &#147;arias&#148; for soprano and tape (the last with G flute too). This last and higher level involves the soprano and a little part of the voice on tape.</p>		<p>I am conscious that extracting just a few fragments from a large piece does not help to understand exactly their role in the whole work, but... So I&#146;ll give you four sections of the score: the introduction (Section 1), the tape part of the first Neruda poem (Section 5), the introduction to the second Neruda poem (Section 6) and the tape parte of the fourth Neruda poem (Section 13)</p>		<p>&#147;I dannati della terra&#148; was first performed in Rome, at &#147;Musica Verticale Festival&#148; on November 17, 1996, by Daniele Fracassi, actor, Maria Chiara Pavone, soprano, Gianni Trovalusci, flutes, and Alessandro Tomassetti, percussions.</p>		<p><a href="242.html">Next</a>	</body></html>
