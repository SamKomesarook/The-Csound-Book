Hommage to Allen</b></p>		<p>&#147;Howl&#148;, composed in 1995 for female voice (the beautiful voice of the mezzosoprano Susan Long, born in Wisconsin but living in Rome) and tape, was realized in the freshly established studio of the Escuela Universitaria de Musica (University Music School) in Montevideo (Uruguay), where I first introduced computer music during a two months course.</p>		<p>The piece is based on fragments of the well known poem by Allen Ginsberg, and there is an attempt to enter the beloved and mysterious world of be-bop and free jazz. My interest was especially pointed on the rythmic aspect. Until then, I mainly used irrational (or, better, &#147;natural&#148;) durations in my music. Here I adopted for the first time an even meter, although it is often broken by irregular accents. I decided to use at times a &#147;real&#148; percussion (instrument 11), and at times a &#147;synthetic&#148; one (instrument 18), with smooth transitions among the two.</p>		<p>The piece was sung for the first time by Susan Long in Rome, in the &#147;Musica Verticale Festival&#148;, on December 12 1995.</p>		<p><a href="232.html">Next</a>	</body></html>
