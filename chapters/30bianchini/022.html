What is &#147;Macchu Picchu&#148;?</b></p>		<p>&#147;Macchu Picchu&#148; was inspired by the reading of a poem by Pablo Neruda, &#147;Alturas de Macchu Picchu&#148; (<i>Highties of Macchu Picchu</i>), from his &#147;Canto General&#148;. Macchu Picchu is the well known Inca city discovered about 1910 in the Andes, at 12,000 feet. Pablo Neruda&#146;s poem is concerned with the many men and women who build the city:</p>		<p><i>Stone in the stone, and the men, where was he?</i></p>		<p><i>Air in the air, and the men, where was he?</i></p>		<p><i>Time in the time, and the men, where was he?</i></p>		<p>I decided to write a piece for my wind ensemble and tape. It was the spring of 1993, and the firsts 16-bit sound boards for PC have just begun to appear in Italy. Naturally, I ran out and bought one, using Csound version for PC by John Fitch.</p>		<p>Being my first piece made with Csound, I revisited some old studio techniques of the Fifties, particularly the use of filtered white noise (<i>rand</i>, for Csounders) and band pass filtered pulses (do you remember Stockhausen&#146;s &#147;Kontakte&#148;?).</p>		<p>The form of the piece is something like a bow, a bow in the time: I imagined to be a visitor in the ruins of the city, in the wind, and to see the ancient citizens come back to life to tell the story of how Macchu Picchu was built: the joys, the cruelnesses, the life on the Incas.</p>		<p>This introductory part is for tape alone. It evokes an almost impressionistic athmosphere, and after a while a sort of pan flute sounds in the farness.</p>		<p>The piece was first played in Rome, on November 21 1993, with <i>Farfensemble</i> conducted by myself.</p>		<p><a href="222.html">Next</a>	</body></html>
