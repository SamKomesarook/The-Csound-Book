The End</b></font></p>		<p><b>V.1. Conclusion</b></p>		<p>Since I started my journey in computer music I used a number of computers and music softwares: from the IBM 360 and IBM 370, passing through the Apple II with Mountain Hardware Music System, to PC+MIDI, and finally to Csound.</p>		<p>No doubt that Csound is a very powerful tool: it is estensible, customizable and you can do almost all with it, if you have a little informatic skill. Sure, its learning curve is a little steep, but, at least, this serves to keep clear people who would like to make good music (well, good sounds) without effort, and to help me to keep my job teaching Csound!	</body></html>
