Introduction</b></font></p>		<p>My interest in composing with computer has always been focalized on building a bridge between instrumental and synthetic sound. I did never like so-called &#147;electronic sound&#148;, so you&#146;ll perhaps find my orchestra and scores sounding rather &#147;instrumental&#148;.</p>		<p>Also, my interest has always been more towards putting together instrumental and synthetic sound, rather than composing pieces for tape alone. This for two reasons: the first, I like the richer repertoire given by instruments and electronics (and their interactions); the second, a visual concern: it&#146;s still embarassing listening to sounds without seeing anyone producing them. As my activity includes conducting too, I am particularly sensitive to this (may be it is because when an audience can&#146;t see anyone, they will not applaude...).</p>		<p>So I present here a few instruments from the orchestras I used for three pieces: &#147;Macchu Picchu&#148;, for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, 2 trumpets, horn and bass trombone, &#147;I dannati della terra&#148; (The Damned of the Earth), for actor, soprano, C and G flute, percussion (marimbaphon 3 cymbals, 3 toms, bass drum), and &#147;Canciones para las estrellas&#148; (Songs for the Stars), a tape alone piece.</p>		<p>Clearly, it makes little sense to extract an instrument from the context it was conceived for. So, I&#146;ll need much than a few words to explain this. Please, be patient!</p>		<p>Though I arrived to computer music rather late in my composing life, much or less at the time in which it was finally possible to synthesize good quality sound with a personal computer, my composing methods have always been deeply influenced by mathematics. My first algorithmic piece (Roen, for chamber ensemble, 1981) includes parts &#147;composed&#148; by means of a pocket calculator (one of the firsts Texas Instruments programmable calculator). So it has been only natural that such an open and powerful language, as Csound is, would fit my compositional methods as a glove.</p>		<p><a href="022.html">Next</a>	</body></html>
