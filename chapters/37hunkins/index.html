<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Art Hunkins' interest
in electronic music dates from the earliest days of analog synthesizers.
He attended Bob Moog's Trumansburg, NY workshop in electronic
music in 1965 and shortly thereafter established one of the earliest
analog synthesizer-based university electronic music studios,
at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He was studio
director at UNCG and teacher of composition, theory and electronic
music for 32 years, until retiring in 1997. A composer of a wide
range of electro-acoustic (especially live-performance) and conventional
works, he creates music that is spiritual in inspiration and meditative
in mood. The pieces presented here are his four Csound compositions
to date.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><BR>

is his earliest Csound endeavor, completed in 1990, but having
its roots in an NEH workshop in the 70's at the University of
New Hampshire (using Music360 in a mainframe environment). Nearly
20 years later it was completed on a desktop PC! It has the only
&quot;fixed&quot; <A HREF="viasco.html">score</A> of the group,
designed without the score preprocessor <A HREF="score11.html">Score-11</A>
in mind. Alternating a single, built-up harmonic series with a
seven-inharmonic bell tone, it features random modulation of sinewave
frequency with audio-range noise; it &quot;transforms&quot; from
pure tone to noise bands and back again (so becoming involved
in negative sample increments).&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="giftsorc.html"><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">GIFTS
(1991)</FONT></B></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> is the second
piece solely realized in Csound; but here Score-11 preprocessing
is required--in this case for the basic purpose of randomizing
start and duration times while retaining control over &quot;average
event spacing.&quot; Several other parameters are randomized as
well: frequency, and &quot;cloud rhythm&quot;--including whether
&quot;clouds&quot; are repeated in total or in part. (The &quot;cloud&quot;
instrument is <A HREF="giftsorc.html">#7</A>). A global reverb
(<A HREF="giftsorc.html">instrument #8</A>) is used for the &quot;cloud&quot;
only.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whereas the previous works are
mono, both LUX HOMINUM (1994) and IN VITAM VENTURI (1995) are
here in stereo, though they exist in mono (and several alternate)
versions as well. (For alternate versions and further information,
please <A HREF="mailto:abhunkin@hamlet.uncg.edu">contact the composer</A>.)
Both make crucial use of Score-11 preprocessing, and additionally
invite the user's involvement in customizing the realization.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="luxorc.html"><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">LUX HOMINUM</FONT></B></A><B><FONT
 FACE="Times New Roman"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">actually
comprises eight variable and fixed forms (four written in &quot;straight&quot;
Csound; four requiring Score-11 preprocessing). (A previous version
of the work is for 2-op FM sound card and MIDI file player. In
Cakewalk implementation, several of the randomization and user
customizations described below are accomplished through CAL routines.)
Two versions are presented here: a &quot;fixed&quot; version using
<A HREF="luxsco.html">lux.sco</A> and <A HREF="luxorc.html">lux.orc</A>,
and one in which <A HREF="luxs11.html">lux.s11</A> is to be processed
by Score-11 and its &quot;score&quot; output paired with <A HREF="lux11orc.html">lux11.orc</A>.
Of particular interest in the present versions is the &quot;numinous&quot;
quality of the instruments, which is created by applying small
amounts of random subaudio amplitude modulation to the audio signal.
A similar technique (but in this case random <I>frequency</I>
modulation) applies in ET VITAM VENTURI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">User customizable parameters in
LUX HOMINUM include the following: variable tempo, basic transposition
level, choice of modulation waveform (the piece consists of simple
FM bell tones, each based on the identical carrier frequency),
and modulation index (for &quot;tone color&quot; control). These
factors are fine-tuned in either .sco or .orc files. Additionally,
tone color entry order can be manually regulated by the user in
the .sco file.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="vitamorch.html"><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">ET
VITAM VENTURI III</FONT></B></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">
exists in two previous--in this case live performance--incarnations:
ET VITAM VENTURI for two Yamaha PSS480 or PSS680 synthesizers,
and ET VITAM VENTURI II for Yamaha FB01 or TX81Z Tone Generator
and MIDI Keyboard. The Csound rendition (III) is variable, not
fixed, requiring Score-11 for actual <A HREF="vitamssco.html">score</A>
generation. Its randomized elements are event start/duration and
stereo placement. User customization comprises tempo specification,
starting pitch (including an option for random selection), and
several choices of modulation index (this piece too is based on
simple bell tones).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The most unique feature of ET
VITAM VENTURI III is its invitation to the user to create his/her
own unique bell tones. <A HREF="vitamtor.html">Vitamt.orc</A>
and <A HREF="vitamtsc.html">.sco</A> are furnished for this purpose.
Complete instructions for such creation are included in the <A
HREF="vitamtsc.html">vitamt.sco</A> file (which is not to be processed
by Score-11). From the sonic output of the vitamt files, the user
selects the sonorities he/she prefers, and inserts the corresponding
values in the scorefile generated by Score-11 and <A HREF="vitams11.html">vitam.s11</A>.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As can be readily understood from
the above commentary, the composer is particularly interested
in <I>variable</I> and multiple renderings of his Csound and other
electronic works. In the case of Csound, he does this by randomizing
crucial parameters (within specified limits) and by inviting the
user to &quot;customize&quot; realizations. A major motivation
for these efforts is the desire to recreate in the Csound environment
some of the &quot;you are there&quot; excitement of live (concert)
performance, where each rendition is unique to some degree. In
this regard, <I>MIDI-controlled, real-time</I> Csound is a new
creative adventure on which the composer is looking to embark
with great expectation.</FONT></P>

A brief word about <B>Score-11</B>: for basic information about
Score-11 and its upcoming availability in a revised version, see
<A HREF="score11.html">score11.htm</A>. Since Score-11 user materials
are NOT included here, files for the works discussed above always
include traditional .sco scores--so that representative renditions
of these compositions may be readily experienced.</FONT>
