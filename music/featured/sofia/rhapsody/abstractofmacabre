Because of a state of mindthe person can experience an unexpectedly shocking dream that engages or createsthe surreal situation that aggressive actions are being conducted against him orher in a grusome death and decay. Part I The composition starts by setting the stage and drama of the dream.  Thetimbre is dark and moves slowly through valleys of thoughts creating a false feeling of security, like "do not worry... choose which way you would like to go".The sounds between parts have a short decay to create that everything is not allright.   Part II Starts darker and move sinister and moves through deep voice sounds thatare chant-like which articulates an intense environment.  "how many are there?Who are they? What do they want?"  Thus preparing the scenario for the ultimatebehavior in the dream.    Part III The last part of the composition is a string of vignettes with dramaticsounds shading to create images in the subconscious. They are machine-like a metaphor for the mechanism of any strata society...who are the tourturers as opposed to the tortured.
