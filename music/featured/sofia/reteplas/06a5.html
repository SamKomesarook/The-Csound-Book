By doing this organized work we are giving shape to the music. Two different composers using the same system, or algorithm, would naturally create compositions totally unlike in mood and style.<br>		<br>		The preceding steps to Example 3 are explained in detail in Chapter I of my thesis, and furnish the order of pitch and rhythmic events.</p>		<p>Tempo, meter, and note(s) duration are three elements that work together to determine the pulse in the composition; the melodies in Reteplas were composed by retaining the method of the algorithm that is, the total amount of letters in a word would constitute the group of notes used in a measure. If changes become necessary because of musical considerations, the changes should be effected with stylistic consistency. This section and the next, illustrate some methods used to work the note sequences into a finished piece.</p>		<p>In the following example the words <i>&quot;Exaudi orationem meam,</i> <i>Domine&quot;</i> (first line from the Latin text) were translated into microtonality. In the first measure the word &quot;Exaudi&quot; was set as six notes in 2/4 time. (This is only arbitrary; the group could have been six quarter notes in 4/4 time or some other denomination). The word &quot;Domine&quot; in measure 4 was placed in two groups of 3:2 in 4/4 time, because the words are similar in that they both have a triplet rhythmic sound when spoken. The meaning of the Latin words &quot;Exaudi&quot; is &quot;grant me&quot; and &quot;Domine&quot; is derived from &quot;dominator&quot; or &quot;ruler,&quot; in this case, &quot;Lord&quot;. The notes from the word &quot;Domine&quot; as a whole were converted into greater denominations. In the first measure &quot;Exaudi&quot; has been subjected to a small variation because a small (upbeat) anticipation was needed to counteract the eighth note triplet feeling. Note that the alteration was done with a subdivision of the eighth note triplet that is a sixteenth note triplet.<b> </b></p>		<p><b>Example 3</b>: First part of <i>Reteplas</i> mm. 1-4.<br>		</p>		<p><img src="figures/a5reteplas_b.gif" alt="[Picture a5Reteplas]"><br>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		<a href="01.html">Up one level</a><br>		<a href="index.html">Back to document index</a></p>		<p><em>Original file name: a5Reteplas - converted on Tuesday, 24 June 1997, 21:00 </em>		<hr>	</body></html>
