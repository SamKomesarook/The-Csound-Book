Some of the vowels were not included because their combinations would result in the same steps and frequency ratios as mentioned in the table.</p>		<p>Please note that some microtone pitch intervals in the analysis were prefixed with e.g. &quot;Sharp&quot; Major 3rd, and &quot;Flat&quot; Perfect 4th in order to define their pitch positions.<b> </b></p>		<p><b>Example 6:</b> Consonance vowel interval analysis.</p>		<p><img src="figures/b2reteplas_b.gif" alt="[Picture b2Reteplas]"><br>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		<a href="08.html">Up one level</a><br>		<a href="index.html">Back to document index</a></p>		<p><em>Original file name: b2Reteplas - converted on Tuesday, 24 June 1997, 21:00 </em>		<hr>	</body></html>
