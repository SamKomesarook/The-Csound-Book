This method was applied to microtones by dividing one octave into twenty-six microtones, with the &quot;Diatonic Equal Tuning&quot;2 system. In any such system, the interval relationships between notes is unchanged in moving from one key to another. The microtone frequencies were derived from A1 = 55 Hz. The table below describes the alphabet, musical notes, frequency (Hertz), ratio, and size of interval in cents (100 cents = 1 semitone ).</p>		<p>2.
