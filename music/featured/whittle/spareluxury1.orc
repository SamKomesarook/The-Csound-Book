; Together with SL_ONE.SCO, this produces a 7 minute 40 sec contemplative
; binarual stereo sound massage. It sounds fine over speakers or headphones.
;
; For a text only description of the binaural model used in this piece,
; see the doco which is at the end of the SL_ONE.SCO file.
; Unfortunately Csound spits the dummy if I include doco of that length in 
; the .ORC file. 
; 
; The code is reasonably self explanatory when this overview is understood.
;
; Based on Spare Luxury 19    20 April 1995
;
; On the IBM, I use the following command line to execute these files.
;
; cs -W -R -d -m7 -oSL_ONE.wav -H e:\cs\SL_ONE.orc e:\cs\SL_ONE.sco
;
; It should display a line for each second of sound it produces.
; Each second could take 90 seconds or so on a 486DX33.  This takes around
; 11 hours to complete, generating an 83 Megabyte 44.1 KHz stereo 
; SL_ONE.WAV file.
;
; If I want to stop it, I hold Ctrl and press Pause (Break).  The next time it
; puts out a one second report line, it terminates.
;
; Then I use the Windows 3.1 Media player (In the Accessories group) to 
; play it.  Alternatively I use the DOS play program which came with the 
; 16 bit stereo sound card. Under DOS or Windows, sound card volume controls 
; are a pain, so I took direct feeds from the 16 Bit DAC chip (via capacitors) 
; and now I don't need to worry about setting the pesky analog mixer or about
; the noise and distortion it generates.

; Instrument 95 Binaural mix system - Robin Whittle 20 April 1995
;         See also instrument 90 which locates the head.
;         
;         Binaural mix system, uses a gax variable for sound input.
;         Does all other location and mix stuff itself.
;         
;         Super version with differing axes for extra time delay and
;         volume & high frequency gain.
;
;         In addition to the basic binaural time delays, there are 
;         three sets of directionality cues:
;
;         1/ The extra time sound takes to go around the head to the
;            far ear.
;
;         2/ Reduced volume when sound is more than 50 degrees of axis
;            from the forward pointing 40 degree from left/right axis
;            which the ear is assumed to be pointing along.
;            (This is not really required for binarual, or not to a 
;             great degree, it is mainly to enhance the placement when
;             listened to on speakers.) 
;
;         3/ Lowered high frequency response for far ear on the same 
;            axis.
;
;         In the original version of the binaural model, I did these
;         using the axis between the ears - there was no forward to 
;         backwards difference.  Now for each ear, the axis for volume 
;         and frequency response is 40 degrees forward, and the axis for 
;         extra time delay is 40 degrees backwards.
;
;         This is because the outer ear points forwards, but is rear of 
;         the centre of the head.
;
;         In each case the angle is more than would be true of a real
;         head, but I am trying to accentuate the naturally weak 
;         forward to backward cues. 
;
;         This involves calculating distances to two extra points, 
;         tan 40 = 0.84 of an ear distance in front of and 
;         behind the centre of the head (between the ears).
;         The ears are assumed to be 0.25 msec from the centre, so
;         we need points 0.209 in front of and behind the centre.
;         When the sound is on one of these axes, the maximum delay 
;         difference could be .3258 msec. 
;
;         The X,Y postitions of the two ears and the two reference 
;         points are already calculated and available as golbal 
;         variables.
;
;         I don't claim that this approach is unique or optimal, or
;         that it does not infringe any software patents.  If you
;         have fun with it I would really appreciate a copy of your
;         .SCO and .ORC files - to: firstpr@ozemail.com.au or to
