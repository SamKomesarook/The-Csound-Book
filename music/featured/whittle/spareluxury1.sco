;
; BINAURAL MODEL OVERVIEW - Robin Whittle 20 April 1995
;
; Binaural recordings in the physical world involve two microphones on a 
; real or dummy head, to record what a person would hear if they were at that
; spot.  This creates time delays, volume changes, filtering etc, which 
; the human ear and brain uses to determine the locality of sounds.
; When listened to on headphones, the brain can use these cues almost as well
; as it could if the person's head was really there.  This gives a feeling of
; being somewhere, with the music surrounding you.
;
; This Csound code aims to produce satisfying binarual recordings for both
; headphone and speaker playback.  This represents a compromise from a pure
; headphone arrangement, where differing volumes in each channel are not
; as pronounced as are required to get good placement with speakers.
;
; The aim is to make a sensual spacious "recording" system, rather than 
; something which is technically accurate. Although I have gone to quite a lot
; of trouble to give a front/back perspective (which is weak even with a 
; natural head) the aim has been to minimise the computations involved, so as
; not to bog Csound down too much.  I am using a 486DX33, so I a can't afford
; to waste CPU time.
;
; The Space
; ---------
;
; There is an X (left to right, west to east) dimension, a Y (back to front, 
; south to north) dimension and a Z (down to up) dimension. 
;
;              +Y
;
;    
;          -X   O   +X
;
;
;              -Y
;
; Sound sources can be moved around anywhere in these dimensions, and the 
; sound source has no directionality.
;
; The head is always at Z = 0.  Its axis is vertical (pointing to +Z) and 
; it can be rotated on this axis.
;
; In keeping with the geometry I learnt at school, a positive rotation is 
; anti-clockwise (ACW), but the starting point is where the nose is 
; pointing - along the positive Y axis.
;
; Instrument 90 does this, as well as move the head.  The head location and 
; the location of the two ears and the two reference points are all global
; control rate variables.  A more advanced system than Instrument 90 could be 
; devised to move the head.
;
; All dimensions in this space are in msec of sound - approximately a foot or
; 30 cm.  There is a global variable for the maximum delay time in the
; binaral model - be sure that ears and sound sources are not separated by 
; more than this time (in seconds) or the code will attempt to get longer
; delay times (this could crash it). There is no performance penalty (I think)
; in assigning longer delay times, but it chews memory - at 44.1 kHz, with 4
; bytes for each sample, a 0.3 second delay (max 300 feet between sound source
; and ears) takes up 52,920 bytes - so the limitation is how much memory 
; you have to play with before (on the MSDOS version) Csound starts using 
; slower forms of memory - virtual memory via hard-disk.
;
; The basic delay and volume algorithm
; ------------------------------------
;
; Most of the binaural effect comes from delaying the left and right ear 
; signals exactly according to the distance from the source to each ear, and
; by scaling the volume of each signal in proportion to the inverse square
; of the distance.
;
; In this case, I decided to do it to the inverse power 1.5 instead, since
; the space is totally empty, and the power 2 was rather severe in attenuating
; volume as the sound moved away.  If I start to use reflectors in the space,
; I could choose to change this.  Also, for bass sounds, in the physical world
; the sound source has a significant area, so doubling the distance would not 
; lead to a 1/4 level.  Likewise the size of a room encloses the sound - 
; especially for bass frequencies.
;
; If this delay and volume was all we were doing, we would get a striking
; binaural effect, which has no forward or backward cue.  It is relatively 
; easy to code, and gives most of the effect.
;
; Ear directionality - volume and frequency response
; --------------------------------------------------
;
; To simulate the fact that the outer ear picks up high frequency sounds
; better when they are coming straight into it, I do several things.
;
; Firstly I control the volume of the sound according to direction - where
; the axis of the right ear is assumed to be 40 degrees forward of the left-
; right line which passes through both ears. In fact I expect that any such
; axis would be less than 40 degrees, but I have made it more to accentuate
; front/back perceptions.
;
; If the sound comes from within a 50 degree range of this 40 degree axis, 
; then volume is normal.  Outside this it falls off, leading to a 
; minimum when the sound is coming from the opposite end of the 40 degree axis,
; from the left and behind, in the case of the right ear.
;
; Note that at no stage do I calculate angles - there is no arc-tan function
; to do this (although a table could be used).  The calculations are based
; on the differences in distances times from the source to the ear and to a 
; rear reference point, at the centre of the head and 40 degrees behind the 
; ear.
;
; We need a top view diagram! 
; (This may be elongated on your screen. Blind people search for END to get
; past the diagram.)
;
; O is the centre of the head, about which it rotates on a vertical axis.

; S2
;
; END
;
; The distance between the ears is assumed to be 6 inches - 0.5 msec.
;
; The axis for volume and filtering is level and at 0 Z elevation.
; For the right ear it extends through the B point and the R ear location.
;
; S1 and S2 depict sources which are directly on this axis.  A source at 
; Z = 0, directly in front of the nose (and a long way away) would be at
; 50 degrees from this axis, and so would come through at normal volume.
; If it was a little to the left, it would be more than 50 degrees and the 
; volume would be attenuated.  If it was at the S2 location, its volume 
; would be attenuated the most.
;
; Sound sources can have + or - Z elevations.  This 50 degree limit resembles
; a cone around the axis, so if S1 was 50 degrees above the ear, then it 
; would be on the verge of having its right ear level attenuated.
; 
; The details of how I change the volume can be seen in the code.  All of these
; could be fine-tuned more than I have done so far.
;
; The second factor is a greatly increased attenuation for the highest 
; frequencies when the source approaches the S2 position, because short
; wavelength sounds do not diffract well around the head.
;
; There is a mechanism for making this occur within around 80 degrees of the
; S2 end of the axis, with the effect getting much stronger as the source
; approaches the axis.
;
; There is also a mechanism for reducing the cutoff frequency of these filters
; as the source approaches the S2 position.  These mechanisms are partly 
; based on rough guesses and on a few trials to see what was too extreme.
;
; I am aiming for a slightly stronger effect than normal, partly to counter
; the fact that the natural cues are relatively weak, and that it is supposed
; to give some feeling of "going behind the head" (getting quieter and less
; crisp) even on speakers.
;
; Ear directionality - extra delay
; --------------------------------
;
; I have defined a second axis for each ear, sweeping 40 degrees _backwards_ 
; from the left-right line through the ears.  This is for adding a little 
; extra delay when the sound is coming from almost exactly the opposite side
; of the head.  This is because the sound has to wrap around the head.
; 
; The ears on _my_ head are located somewhat behind the physical centre on the 
; head, so the maximum delay would occur (for my right ear) when the source
; was about 25 to 30 degres forward of the left-right axis.  Again I have
; chosen 40 degrees for the mathematical model of the recording head to 
; accentuate the forward/backwards cues.
;
; The extra delay only gets added as the source approaches the extreme of
; where the ear is on the head.  Once again, this forms a conical area, in
; this case it extends to 63 degrees from the axis.  (This may be too far, 
; but the extra delay at this point is very small.)
;
; See the code for how I do this.  Again it is guesswork based on what seemed
; to be physically correct and not too extreme, although this .25 msec 
; delay is greater than the 0.14 theoretical delay of the extra distance 
; a sound must take to get round the back curvature of the head.
;
;
; What is the vertical axis for?
; ------------------------------
;
; There are no specific up/down cues in this model.  The cues in a natural 
; head would not be strong anyway, and I expect they could be inordinately 
; complex to compute (maybe in a decade when I have heaps of CPUs I will do 
; it).
;
; However the Z dimension has a very important function.  There is a big; difference between a sound source going round in a 10 ft radius circle
; going as close as 1 ft from your right ear (eg the circle is in the X and Y
; dimensions and is entirely at Z = 0), and the same circle being 10 ft 
; above your head.
;
; One thing I did to demo this was to have a 30 ft radius circle, with the
; centre at X = -7, Y = +30, and have a buzz sound going round every 8 seconds.
;
; I made a Z cycle as well, with a centre at 50 ft and a very slow cycle 
; bringing it down slowly to Z = 0.  The sound started remotely, with little
; volume change or doppler, but after a while it got more intense and 
; whizzed straight past your ear and nose.  Very dramatic!
;
; What next?
; ----------
;
; I am reasonably happy with the model and want to make some music with it
; rather than fuss over its finer points.  I really like what I have 
; acheived with "Spare Luxury One" (or SL_ONE.ORC and SL_ONE.SCO).
;
; I would really like to make it faster! I expect that some of this could
; be written into internal Csound functions. I haven't attempted compiling
; Csound yet, but it would be worth it to speed up some of this stuff.
;
; The cues could all be refined.  Somewhere I have some info on measurements
; of dummy head recordings, which would help me refine it.
;
; It would be possible to make the head move in the Z plane as well, and to 
; give it tilt etc. - but I am happy to use it as it is.
;
; After getting a bigger hard disk, I will make my output files use floating
; point so I don't have to worry about a scaling factor for the 16 bit output.
; After the Csound run, I will use another program (I will write it in C) to
; read the floating point file, find the largest peaks, and write a second
; .WAV file based on it with appropriate scaling.  I am hanging out for a
; faster CPU too!. SL_ONE takes 11 hours for nearly 8 minutes of music.
;
; Then I may investigate adding reflectors - sources which receive all the 
; other sources (with delay and volume drops based on distance) and "re-trans-
; mit" the sum to the head and all other reflectors.  This would be a monster
; to compute, but there would be no tricky directionality stuff.
; I would probably add some simple reverb into each reflector to make the most
; fun with just four or six reflectors.
;
; Then the fun begins!  Reflectors, sources and the head all moving according
; to various algorithms - including cellular automata.
;
; Lets have a flock of singing sources programmed to fly around the head and
; a head programmed to avoid them as much as possible.  The sounds could 
; rise in stridency as the target was approached.
;
; Or a more sensual experience from a squadron of the aural equivalents of 
; cuttlefish, floating at respectful distance, each doing their own thing as
; part of their society.  [Totally off the topic but ... cuttlefish are a 
; form of squid, with big eyes and tentacles pointing forward.  They 
; communicate with ripples of colour on their bodies.  I have heard that 
; a male could be swimming between a female on the left and a male on the 
; right, and the right side of the central male is quite stable, while the
; left is rippling with colours!]
;
; Sound sources from previously recorded analogue synthesisers - especially
; my Devil Fish modified TB-303 Bassline - jumping around the space according
; to their volume or other aspects of the sound.
;
; Cellular automata of Csound processes which change their locations, listen to
; the sounds they hear there, make their own sounds, and generally do their

; Reverb with moving reflectors - all the walls of a small room expand to 
; resemble a hall . . . reverb with doppler!
;
; Instead of point reflectors, creat a "wall" concept, where the ear (and other
; reflectors on one side of the wall also get reflected sound from sources
; which are on this side of the wall, but are made to appear is if they were 
; in a mirror image - on the other side of the wall.  This may not be too 
; tricky.  Then maybe have the walls move around.

; There are questions of aesthetics here.  Am I trying to make a slavish 
; replication of the physical world?  No - too much hard work, and I am 
; attracted by a relatively pure model.  Interest will come from the 
; interactions of sounds and processes, not from the stunning nature of the
; binaural effects.
;
; Will I use it to make "hyper real" sonic experiences, as if they were real?
; Maybe - but just for fun.
;
; Will I pretend to be doing something in the real world? No.
;
; Whatever the outcome, the easy use of _super_dramatic_ binaural sound 
; experiences could easily be over-done. It is awfully easy to use this
; system just for special effects.  That would be fun for a while, but 
; ultimately it is a yawn.  That is "see how big my tool is" rather than
; "lets see what fiendish and playful things we can do with it". 
;
; In music, as in other sensual aspects of life, my interest is primarily in
; caressing and teasing the listener - but as a Scorpio, I reserve the right 
; to sting when the time is right.
; 
; This Spare Luxury One piece has a few moments of piquancy.  If you want
; to experiment with the wilder side of the binaual model, bring in your own 
; sounds, and have them whizzing right past your face at a hundred feet/sec!
