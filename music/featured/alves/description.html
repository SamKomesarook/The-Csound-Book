Among other things, the scores and orchestras included here illustrate free modulation within just intonation, as described in the chapter &quot;Using Alternate Tunings in Csound.&quot; Included here are the csound orchestra and score files for the music of second half of the piece, which has been broken up into seven sections, each with its own orc and sco files. The resulting sound files were later assembled with a multitrack digital audio editor. This sectional approach proved to be the only practical way to work with such large files. The notes of the piece were originally written in Finale on the Mac, then saved into several MIDI files. The MIDI files were converted to score files via Bill Gardner's MIDI to Csound utility. The MIDI pitch numbers were then converted to just intonation ratios using some simple software I wrote. The Csound instruments used for this piece all modify existing samples, mostly of car sounds and electric guitars. Unfortunately, some of the sounds included on this CD are, for legal reasons, not the same ones that I used on the final version of my piece. However, they approximate my result very closely, and should compile just as well.
