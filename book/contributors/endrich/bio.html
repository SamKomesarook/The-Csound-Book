		</a><br>
		Date of Birth: 25 February 1942<br>
		Place of Birth: Schenectady, New York<br>
		<br>
		Occupation:<br>
		Archer (Tom) Endrich is an independent composer living and working in<br>
		Chippenham, England. He lives with his wife, Liz, and has two<br>
		enormously talented stepsons.<br>
		<br>
		Formative years:<br>
		The family moved to Syracuse, New York, when he was 6 months old.<br>
		<br>
		Interest in music started early: his mom says that while in his crib<br>
		he used to kick his feet to the music of 'The Buckaroos'. His parents<br>
		were very musical, and he got started by studying piano with Miss Richards<br>
		and Mrs. Price; he began composing while in high school at Christian<br>
		Brothers Academy.<br>
		<br>
		1965<br>
		After studies in philosophy (BA 1965, St. Hyacinth College, Mass.), his<br>
		attention became increasingly focussed on music composition.<br>
		<br>
		1967-1969<br>
		While working towards an STB (Bachelor in Sacred Theology), he attended<br>
		summer school sessions at Peabody Conservatory studying music history,<br>
		theory and composition with Louis Cheslock and Stefan Grove.<br>
		<br>
		1969-1971<br>
		At Union College, Schenectady, New York, he studied composition with<br>
		composer/conductor Edgar Curtis, earning a Masters degree in Education.<br>
		Edgar's profound humanity and understanding of musical form has been<br>
		a life-long inspiration.<br>
		<br>
		1971-1975<br>
		He then went to the University of York, England, where he studied<br>
		electronic music with Richard Orton and composition with Bernard Rands,<br>
		and developed an individual style rooted in the study of melody, finding<br>
		particular inspiration in Arabic maqam.<br>
		<br>
		He received the orchestral commission in 1974, for which he wrote<br>
		'Amoeba', a study in the pursuit of personal identity, with 2 conductors,<br>
		one of whom has an acting/speaking role, soprano soloist, and an<br>
		orchestra which speaks and sings as well as plays.<br>
		<br>
		He was active as a performer in the experimental music theatre group<br>
		formed at the University by Bernard Rands. He wrote the music theatre<br>
		piece 'Savari II' for this group, and performed in it as the 'overseer',<br>
		a vocal role.<br>
		<br>
		He graduated in 1975 with a Ph D in composition.<br>
		<br>
		Professional life: 1975 - present<br>
		The focus for the next 10 years was on composition, receiving commissions<br>
		from Yorkshire Arts, Merseyside Arts and Midlands Arts. He is self-<br>
		employed, has also worked as a music editor and copyist for Edition Eulenburg<br>
		and Edition Kunzelman, and has taught part time at Bingley College of<br>
		Further Education, the University of York, Sheffield Polytechnic, and<br>
		the Open University.<br>
		<br>
		During 1976 and 1977 he formed his own music theatre group and presented<br>
		concerts at the Edinburgh Fringe during the summers of both of those<br>
		years, featuring his 'Savari II' and 'The Burial of the Moon' (for<br>
		Bass instrument, electronic tape and actors).<br>
		<br>
		He was active in the local composer/performer organisation SOUNDPOOL, for<br>
		which he wrote several compositions, and in INTERFACE, which was concerned<br>
		with discussing and performing elextroacoustic music. The latter led to<br>
		the formation of The Composers's Desktop Project, an independent company<br>
		which develops and markets a comprehensive desktop computer music system<br>
		for sound design. 'CDP' has been set up as an international cooperative<br>
		effort among composers, and Archer has served as its Coordinator since<br>
		1987. He now enjoys the use of the CDP System in his own compositional<br>
		activities, while continuing his work for the Project.<br>
