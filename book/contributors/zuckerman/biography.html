It wasn&#146;t until midway through his education at the Berklee<br>		College of Music in Boston that he was exposed to computer music--he hasn&#146;t been<br>		the same since. Jeremy received his Bachelor of Music from the Berklee College of<br>		Music and is currently working towards an MFA in Composition--New Media at the<br>		California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. Jeremy is also co-founder of<br>		Dynamic Impulse, a progressive mastering facility.<br>		<br>		Dynamic Impulse<br>		c/o Jeremy Zuckerman<br>		21440 Plane Tree Dr #204<br>		Newhall, CA 91321<br>	</body></html>
