		After taking a degree in Computer Science I started to explore my Computer Music<br>
		interests on the Masters degree in Music Technology at York University, England,<br>
		which I passed with Distinction and was awarded the York University Music<br>
		Technology Year Prize. As final project for the course I developed a computer<br>
		environment for electroacoustic music composition which was subsequently marketed<br>
		by the Composers desktop Project (CDP) company. I was employed at York for the<br>
		following three years on a 96000 pound research contract on work which included<br>
		analysis and synthesis of the singing voice. At the same time I worked on and was<br>
		awarded a DPhil. After moving to Hong Kong in 1995 I was invited to serve as<br>
		co-organiser of the 1996 ICMC, taking on a number of responsibilities including<br>
		Chair of the Papers Selection Committee, Editor of the Conference Proceedings,<br>
		and Editor of the Conference Papers Programme. I was also Chair of the Computer<br>
		Graphics and Computer Music Papers Session, and have been invited to be a member<br>
		of the Papers Panel for the 1997 ICMC. In addition to my academic award from York<br>
		University I was awarded a Research Fellowship at The Chinese University of Hong<br>
		Kong (1995) and received Best Paper award at a Eurographics UK conference (1993).<br>
		I have also been a referee for the Information and Software Technology journal<br>
		special issue on Multimedia Information Systems, and have been a referee and a<br>
		member of the advisory board for the journal Musical Praxis at Edinburgh<br>
		University. I am first author of more than 10 international journal papers and a<br>
		further 10 proceedings papers. Research to date has been involved with a number<br>
		of computer music issues including audio signal processing, virtual reality and<br>
		sonification. Currently I am lecturing at the Computer Science Department of the<br>
		Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am a member of the Audio<br>
		Engineering Society, the IEEE Technical Committee on Computer Generated Music,<br>
		and the International Computer Music Association.<br>
