		Richard Furse is a mathematician, classical musician and computer programmer. He<br>
		studied Maths at Oxford University and Music Technology at the University of<br>
		York. An interest in experimental composition has lead to an increasing interest<br>
		in electroacoustic and algorithmic composition. Over the past few years Richard<br>
		has alternated between working as a contract programmer and time dedicated to<br>
		composition and tool development. He has developed a number of sound synthesis<br>
		and processing tools including HISS and the MN Audio Library. Particular projects<br>
		of the moment include composition, virtual acoustic spaces, second-order<br>
		Ambisonics and arbitrary Z-plane processing.<br>
