Cooper was an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Music Composition,<br>		Co-Director for the M-PACT Center (Music Production and Computer Technology), and<br>		computer consultant for the Conservatory of Music at the University of Missouri -<br>		Kansas City. During his all too brief carreer, he received the National<br>		Foundation for the Advancement of Musical Arts Award, the Leith Stevens Award for<br>		Music Composition, and recently the MTNA/MMTA Composer of the Year Award. He has<br>		published articles for Keyboard Magazine (Co-authored with Richard Boulanger -<br>		Csound Virtual Synthesis) and the International Jazz Educators Association (an<br>		analysis of his work for trumpet and tape - Parking Permitted). His compositions<br>		were featured at the National SEAMUS and SCI Conferences and Internationally in<br>		Brazil (1995 Open Air Electroacoustic Concert in Brazilia) and Poland<br>		(Conservatory of Music - Krakow). The Csound Book is humbly dedicated to the<br>		memory of this wonderful composer, teacher, mentor, father and friend.</p>		<p><img height="320" width="450" src="vercoe.jpg"></p>		<p>[Barry Vercoe &amp; Robert Cooper]</p>		<p><img height="284" width="450" src="students.jpg"></p>		<p>[Robert Cooper &amp; his Students]</p>		<p><br>		<img height="319" width="450" src="haidar.jpg"></p>		<p>[Robert Cooper &amp; Mike Haidar at Analog Devices Inc.]</p>		<p><img height="284" width="450" src="ffitch.jpg"></p>		<p>[John ffitch &amp; Robert Cooper at Analog Devices Inc.]</p>		<p><img height="236" width="450" src="adi.jpg"></p>		<p>[Richard Boulanger, Barry Vercoe, Robert Cooper &amp; John ffitch at Analog Devices Inc.]	</body></html>
