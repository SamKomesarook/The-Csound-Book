		compositions by programming the SID chip of a C64 homecomputer. To learn more<br>
		about sound synthesis, he visited 1986 a course on new electroacoustic music of<br>
		H.W. Erdmann in L&uuml;neburg, Germany, and gave later his first performances. The<br>
		first releases were available 1989 on tape, later CDs followed starting in 1995<br>
		with the release of '731'. In 1997 he graduates in technical informatic and<br>
		working since as chief programmer in a multimedia agency. Nine years after he<br>
		gave up his painting because he realized that painting is outdated, he shows in<br>
		1998 his first exhibition of computer sculptures and interactive art.<br>
