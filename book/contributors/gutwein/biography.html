		Dan Gutwein (b.1951) is an Associate Professor of Music at The College of William<br>
		and Mary where he teaches electronic music, music theory, composition, music<br>
		cognition, and topics in jazz history.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tango Magnetism (1998) for alto<br>
		saxophone and audio CD (soon to be released by Arizona University Recordings), is<br>
		typical of his most recent compositions involving live performers and electronic<br>
		music. Other live-performed electronic works such as Marvin's Lament (1993) and<br>
		Southland (1995) are the results of collaborative efforts with William and Mary<br>
		colleague and poet/vocalist Hermine Pinson.&nbsp; He is currently collaborating with<br>
		poet/play-write Joanne Braxton on an electronic score for a multimedia play<br>
		called Deep River&nbsp; (a three act play based on the theme of the &quot;Middle<br>
		Passage&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995-96 his interest in music cognition lead to the writing of a<br>
		computer-music program called Adaptive Composer, a neural network that learns and<br>
		adapts to patterns from a MIDI input.In addition to writing electronic music and<br>
		cybernetic computer programs, Mr. Gutwein music has been performed throughout the<br>
		United States and in Europe.&nbsp; He has composed works for solo voice and solo<br>
		orchestral instruments, chamber ensemble, orchestra, and an incomplete opera<br>
		portions of which appear on Owl Recording, Inc. (OWL33) &quot;New Music for Synclavier<br>
		II Digital Music System: Prelude to Act I, and &quot;KIDSROMP FANTASIA&quot; from the opera<br>
		&quot;With Honor and With Dignity&quot;.&nbsp; His &quot;Reliquary for Rahsaan&quot; for tenor saxophone<br>
		and tape is published by Dorn Publications.&nbsp; He holds graduate degrees in music<br>
		compositon from the University of Cincinnati, College-Conservatory of Music where<br>
		he studied composition with T. Scott Huston, Norman Dinerstein, Paul M Palombo,<br>
		and Lukas Foss.<br>
