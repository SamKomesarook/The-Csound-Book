He began his work with interactive systems in 1978 with a symphonic work commissioned by the Newton Symphony and Arp Synthesizer company. He has performed his compositions in Eastern and Western Europe, Australia, Asia, and throughout North America. He has premiered works at the Kennedy Center, and appeared on stage performing his Radio Baton and Alternate-Controller Concertos with the Krakow and Moscow Symphonies. In 1986 his composition &quot;Three Chapters from the Book of Dreams&quot; was awarded first prize in the NEWCOMP International Computer Music Competition. In 1990 he introduced interactive computer music to Eastern Europe as a 1990 Senior Fulbright Professor in Computer Music at the Krakow Academy of Music.</p>		<p>Boulanger holds a Ph.D. in Computer Music from the University of California, San Diego where he worked at the Center for Music Experiment's Computer Audio Research Lab. His music is recorded on the NEUMA label. In composition his principal teachers have been Hugo Norden and Roger Reynolds. In computer music, he has collaborated extensively with Barry Vercoe and Max Mathews. He has conducted his computer music research at Bell Labs, CCRMA, the MIT Media Lab, Analog Devices and Interval Research and is currently a Professor of Music Synthesis at the Berklee College of Music where he was honored by Lee Berk with the President&#146;s Award.</p>		<p>&quot;For me, music is a medium through which the inner spiritual essence of all things is revealed and shared. Compositionally, I am interested in extending the voice of the traditional performer through technological means to produce a music which connects with the past, lives in the present and speaks to the future. Educationally, I am interested in helping students see technology as the most powerful instrument for the exploration, discovery, and realization of their true musical nature - their inner voice.&quot;</p>		<p>Dr. Richard Boulanger<br>		Professor, Music Synthesis Department<br>		Berklee College of Music<br>		1140 Boylston Street<br>		Boston MA 02215<br>		</p>		<p><a href="http://www.csounds.com"><img height="280" width="355" src="boulangerheadshot.jpg"></a></p>		<p><a href="http://www.csound.org"><img height="280" width="355" src="boulangerplay.jpg"></a>	</body></html>
