		SILENT RECORDS - 1986 - 1996<br>
		I started Silent Records in 1986, and Pulse Soniq Distribution in 1991. I brought<br>
		Silent from a kitchen table operation to a California Corporation with a staff of<br>
		10 employees, gross sales of $1 Million in 1995, music placed in film/TV and a<br>
		catalog of over 100 releases. At Silent I was responsible for recruiting talent,<br>
		negotiating contracts, coordinating licensing agreements, creating promotional<br>
		ideas, assisting with art direction for CD packaging and merchandising,<br>
		websmithing, editing on all session master tapes, interfacing with our<br>
		pre-mastering engineer, forming a distribution network for sales and composing<br>
		music as an artist on the label.<br>
		<br>
		FILM SOUND - 1990<br>
		Assisitant Music Editor on Wild At Heart and Twin Peaks, Assistant Foley Engineer<br>
		on Driving Miss Daisy, Cold Dog Soup and Neon Empire. Learned about 20 hour work<br>
		days which help prepare me for parenthood by showing me the interesting effects<br>
		sleep deprivation can have.<br>
		<br>
		AKG/ORBAN - 1984 -1991<br>
		Worked as a tech where I calibrated and repaired compressor/limiters and stereo<br>
		synthesizers. Between the ceiling of the factory being made of silver plastic and<br>
		no-one being allowed to talk the place had a very Lynchian feeling. Bob Orban is<br>
		a *very* cool guy.<br>
		<br>
		ADA - 1983<br>
		Worked as an electronic technician working on digital delays.<br>
		<br>
		EVENTIDE CLOCKWORKS - 1982 - 1983<br>
		Worked as a tech where I calibrated and repaired digital delays and harmonizers.<br>
		Learned certain Firesign Theater plays by heart on company time.<br>
		<br>
		MAX NEUHAUS - 1983<br>
		I was a technical assistant to composer Max Neuhaus on a sound installation<br>
		project for the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This installation focused on<br>
		creating various directional cues in a room by pulsing the room with a dozen<br>
		sound modules that emitted random tone bursts.<br>
		<br>
		CRUMAR SYNTHESIZERS - 1981-1982<br>
		Worked as a tech for a music synthesizer manufacturer. I took synths shipped from<br>
		the factory in Italy and re-tweaked all the patches to ones &quot;better suited to the<br>
		American market&quot;. I learned more than I wanted to know about voodoo from a<br>
		Haitian co-worker who was also a voodoo priest...went to a Christmas party at his<br>
		house in Brooklyn and made sure not to ingest anything.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		BELLEVUE HOSPITAL BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LAB - 1980 - 1981<br>
		Worked as an biomedical engineering technican, where I worked in various parts of<br>
		the hospital such as OR's, ICU's, the emergency room, the mental ward, and the<br>
		Hospital prison where I was accompanied by two armed guards. Got to see lots of<br>
		gory stuff like trauma victims, various kinds of surgery and death. Remember<br>
		eating in the cafeteria next to doctors reading surgical tech magazines with full<br>
		color photos. Learned to always carry airline barf bags while on the job. I<br>
		passed on the Biomedical Engineering field trip to Forensic for the autopsy demo.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		ELECTRONICS FOR MEDICINE - 1976-1980<br>
		I worked for EFM in various capacities but wound up becoming an engineering<br>
		technician. During this time I attended night school to study electronics. When<br>
		the company was sold to Honeywell in 1979 the owner (who was a millionaire<br>
		socialist) gave bonuses to everyone...my bonus paid for my first multitrack<br>
		recorder.<br>
