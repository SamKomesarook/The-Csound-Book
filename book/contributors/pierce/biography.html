		<p>I am currently employed as Senior Music Technician at Bath Spa University<br>
		College.&nbsp; My main interest is in computer music, particularly the use of Csound.&nbsp;<br>
		When I was asked to contribute a piece, I wanted to produce a work that had<br>
		something in common with a track from my lastest CD&nbsp; &quot;BEATSYSTEM 2297 &quot;, released<br>
		September 1997 on EM:T Records. The result is a piece that uses the same source<br>
		material and similar processes to the similarly named track on the CD. I am<br>
		particularly interested in the possibilities of granular synthesis - I like the<br>
		fluid textures it can produce, and the variety of ways in which it can be<br>
		implemented.<br>
