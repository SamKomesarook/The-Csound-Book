		Max V. Mathews was born in Columbus, Nebraska, on November 13, 1926. He studied<br>
		electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology and the<br>
		Massachusetts Institute of Technology receiving a Sc.D. in 1954. He worked in<br>
		acoustic research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories from 1955 to 1987 where he wrote<br>
		programs (Music I through Music V and Groove) for playing music on digital<br>
		computers. For this pioneering work he has been called the father of computer<br>
		music.<br>
		<br>
		In 1987 he joined the Stanford University Music Department in the Center for<br>
		Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) as Professor of Music<br>
		(Research). Here he developed a new pickup for electron violins and a real-time<br>
		computer system for music performance called the Conductor and Improv Programs<br>
		and a 3D MIDI Controller called the Radio Baton.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Computer performance of music was born in 1957 when an IBM 704 in NYC played a<br>
		17 second composition on the Music I program which I wrote. The timbres and notes<br>
		were not inspiring, but the technical breakthrough is still reverberating. Music<br>
		I led me to Music II through V. A host of others wrote Music 10, Music 360, Music<br>
		15, Csound, Cmix. Many exciting pieces are now performed digitally. The IBM 704<br>
		and its siblings were strictly studio machines--they were far too slow to<br>
		synthesize music in real-time. Chowning's FM algorithms and the advent of fast,<br>
		inexpensive, digital chips made real-time possible, and equally important, made<br>
		it affordable. Starting with the Groove program in 1970, my interests have<br>
		focused on live performance and what a computer can do to aid a performer. I made<br>
		a controller, the radio-baton, plus a program, the conductor program, to provide<br>
		new ways for interpreting and performing traditional scores. In addition to<br>
		contemporary composers, these proved attractive to soloists as a way of playing<br>
		orchestral accompaniments. Singers often prefer to play their own accompaniments.<br>
		Recently I have added improvisational options which make it easy to write<br>
		compositional algorithms. These can involve precomposed sequences, random<br>
		functions, and live performance gestures. The algorithms are written in the &quot;C&quot;<br>
		language. We have taught a course in this area to Stanford undergraduates for two<br>
		years. To our happy surprise, the students liked learning and using &quot;C&quot;.<br>
		Primarily I believe it gives them a feeling of complete power to command the<br>
		computer to do anything it is capable of doing.&quot;<br>
