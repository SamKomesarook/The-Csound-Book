		I work as an integrated circuit process engineer. My current area is front<br>
		end etch. I began working at Cray Research in 1986 as an IC process<br>
		technician in the back end etch area. Over the past ten years I have worked<br>
		in metal etch, via etch, map &amp; probe, test, failure analysis,<br>
		photolithography, front-end thin films, ion implant, back-end thin films and<br>
		front end etch.<br>
		<br>
		One of my specialties is statistical design of experiments. I am also<br>
		interested in statistical process control, TRIZ, production simulation and<br>
		total quality programs. I am not fanatical about any of these methods but if<br>
		I find something in them that works for me I will use it. The most useful<br>
		experimental design for me has been either the four run/three variable<br>
		fractional factorial or the four run/two variable full factorial. Iterations<br>
		of these two designs are very effecient for my applications.<br>
		<br>
		I am married to a wonderful woman Laurie and I am kept busy by my two<br>
		teenage stepdaughters, Jacqueline and Megan, and my two year old son,<br>
		Matthew. My hobbies include music, art, science and computers.<br>
		<br>
		I play several instruments including (in order of ability...best to worst)<br>
		Harmonica, Acoustic Bass, Synthesizers, Guitar, Recorder and Theremin.<br>
