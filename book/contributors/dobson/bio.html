He<br>		trained as a flute-player and composer at the Royal College of Music in London,<br>		while also developing a career as a flute maker and repairer. Around 1983 he<br>		joined Bath Spa University College (B.S.U.C) as a visiting flute teacher. In 1988<br>		he purchased the Composers Desktop Project (CDP) system, based initially on the<br>		Atari ST computer, and among the first personal computer systems to support<br>		Csound. His original plans to compose soon gave way to a rapidly increasing<br>		interest in programming, and in technical writing. In 1992 his book 'A Dictionary<br>		of Electronic and Computer Music Technology' was published by Oxford University<br>		Press. The following year he joined Bath University as a Visiting Research<br>		Fellow, on the invitation of John Fitch, leading to a deeper interest in the<br>		development of Csound, as well as to the joint publication of a couple of<br>		research papers. He is now a Core Developer for CDP, working closely with Archer<br>		Endrich and Trevor Wishart. Current interests include the development of<br>		graphical tools for composers, multi-channel audio, and sound-related file<br>		formats. He still teaches at B.S.U.C, and has encouraged several students to<br>		incorporate electronic resources into their repertoire.<br>		<br>		Richard Dobson<br>		1 Ivy Cottage<br>		Church Lane<br>		Cloford<br>		nr Frome,<br>		Somerset BA11 4PH<br>		UK<br>		<br>	</body></html>
