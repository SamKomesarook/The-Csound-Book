		<p>Art Hunkins' interest in electronic music dates from the earliest days of analog<br>
		synthesizers. He attended Bob Moog's Trumansburg, NY workshop in electronic music<br>
		in 1965 and shortly thereafter established one of the earliest analog<br>
		synthesizer-based university electronic music studios, at the University of North<br>
		Carolina at Greensboro. He was studio director there and teacher of composition,<br>
		theory and electronic music for 32 years, until retiring in 1997. A composer of a<br>
		wide range of electro-acoustic (especially live- performance) and conventional<br>
		works, he composes music that is spiritual in inspiration and meditative in mood.<br>
		The pieces presented here are his four Csound compositions to date.<br>
