		Born in 1968, Israel. I am a musician who works in his own recording studio.<br>
		During the last five years, I have been coordinating the production of four CD<br>
		projects for &quot;Chains&quot; record label. My involvement in these projects included<br>
		composing, arranging, playing and sound engineering. In addition, I have been<br>
		involved in various recording and mixing projects in different styles of music. I<br>
		have experienced teaching of sound and recording techniques to students of<br>
		diverse backgrounds. For the last two years, my main interest has been the<br>
		development of algorithms of signal processing for musical applications. One of<br>
		my works &quot;The Musical Effect of Cross-Vocoding&quot; was published in the last ICMC<br>
		proceedings. Another paper regarding a new method for envelope detection is now<br>
		in preparation. I am now concluding my studies for B.Sc. in computer-science at<br>
		the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology. I have chosen to combine these<br>
		studies with my concurrent musical activities. Thus, building a tuition program<br>
		that supports and strengthens technical abilities that are relevant for my work.<br>
		My experience in software engineering includes design and development of<br>
		commercial systems, such as a large-scale communications software package for the<br>
		English software company &quot;Aldoda Ltd.&quot;.<br>
