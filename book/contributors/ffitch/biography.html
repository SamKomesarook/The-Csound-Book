		John ffitch was definitely born after WWII, in that part of the United Kingdom<br>
		which is God's own county, certainly educated at an East Anglian university in<br>
		the sixties, and despite his long hair and beard, and the uncertain spelling of<br>
		his name, was never a hippie. His entire professional career has been as an<br>
		academic mathematician/computer scientist, and for most of that time he has held<br>
		the Chair of Software Engineering at Bath, a subject about which he knows little.<br>
		His main interests have been in Relativity, Planetary Astronomy, Computer Algebra<br>
		and LISP, but he has been known to dabble widely, for example in tank warfare,<br>
		Latin poetry, arabic linguistics, and company management, all with some lack of<br>
		success. Strangely enough he won the Adams Prize for Mathematics 20 years ago.<br>
		Hobbies include maintaining Csound and receiving e-mail.<br>
