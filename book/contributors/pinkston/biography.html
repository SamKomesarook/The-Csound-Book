		<p>Russell Pinkston (b. 1949) is an Associate Professor of Music Composition and<br>
		Director of Electronic Music Studios at The University of Texas at Austin. He<br>
		holds degrees in music composition from Dartmouth College (BA 1975) and Columbia<br>
		University (MA 1978, and DMA 1984). He has written music in a wide variety of<br>
		different media, ranging from concert works and sacred anthems to computer<br>
		generated tape pieces and live electronic music for dance. His compositions have<br>
		been played throughout Europe, South America and the United States, including<br>
		performances by such noted ensembles as the Danish Royal Ballet, the Kansas City<br>
		Symphony Orchestra, the Sharir Dance Company, and the Smith Quartet. His research<br>
		involving interactive technologies for dance has received international<br>
		attention, leading to interviews with CBCN and BBC News, an article in New<br>
		Scientist Magazine, and a feature story in CNN's Science and Technology Week. His<br>
		musical compositions have also been widely recognized, including two major awards<br>
		from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, a Guggenheim<br>
		Fellowship, and a senior Fulbright Fellowship to Brazil. Pinkston's music is<br>
		recorded on Boston Skyline, Centaur, Finnadar, Folkways, and Summit Records and<br>
		published by Galaxy Music, E. C. Schirmer, and Columbia University Press.<br>
