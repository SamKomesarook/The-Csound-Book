		Stephen David Beck teaches at Louisiana State University where he is an<br>
		Associate Professor of Composition, Director of the Electro-Acoustic Music<br>
		Studios and Co-Director of the Music &amp; Art Digital (The MAD) Studio. Dr.<br>
		Beck is also chair of the LSU Festival of Contemporary Music. He holds a<br>
		Ph.D. in music composition and theory from UCLA, where he studied with<br>
		Henri Lazarof, Elaine Barkin, and Alden Ashforth. In 1985, he received a<br>
		Fulbright Fellowship to study computer music at the Institut de Recherche<br>
		et Coordination Acoustique/Musique in Paris. While his studies have<br>
		included both traditional and technological media, his recent works have<br>
		focused on computer-based interactive compositions, where acoustic<br>
		performers play with and in counterpoint to computer-controlled<br>
		synthesizers. He has received numerous commissions, grants and awards,<br>
		most recently from saxophonist Griffin Campbell, harpist Ann Benjamin,<br>
		Baton Rouge Playmakers, the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra, and the Misade<br>
		Trio.<br>
		<br>
		His music has been performed throughout the world, including performances<br>
		at Weill Recital Hall, Sao Paolo Bienal '91, SCREAM Radio Series, New Music<br>
		America, World Harp Congress, and on the Triforium Series in Los Angeles.<br>
		Beck has also presented lectures and papers on his research in interactive<br>
		computer music at recent meetings of the International Computer Music<br>
		Association, the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States<br>
		(SEAMUS), and the Society of Composers, Inc. He is currently President of<br>
		SEAMUS.<br>
