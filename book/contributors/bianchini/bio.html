		I was born in 1946 in Milan (Italy), where I studied Piano and Composition under<br>
		Bruno Canino, Electroacoustic Music under Angelo Paccagnini, and Engineering at<br>
		the Politecnico University. Since 1974 I have been&nbsp;professor of Electronic Music<br>
		in the Conservatories of Pescara and later Milan, and since 1987 in Conservatorio<br>
		&#147;S.Cecilia&#148; in Rome. My interest in computer music dates 1973, and I worked (but<br>
		did not produce any work) with MUSIC 360 and Music 11. I teached in a&nbsp;number of<br>
		summer courses in Italy (Varenna, Citt&agrave; di Castello and Montepulciano) and abroad<br>
		(1995, 1996,&nbsp;1997 invited professor in&nbsp;Escuela Unversitaria de Musica,<br>
		Montevideo, Uruguay, and in LIPM, Buenos Aires, Argentina). I collaborated with<br>
		publishers Feltrinelli and Ricordi as a transator (The Oxford History of Music,<br>
		Vol. X, Henri Pousseur's&nbsp; La musica elettronica, Charles Rosen's The Classical<br>
		Style and Sonata Forms, R.Dick's The Other Flute) and as a writer(Appendix to<br>
		Oxford History of Music, &#147;La nuova musica in Italia&#148;, Feltrinelli-Fischer<br>
		Encyclopedy) and published articles in music magazines and reviews (Musica,<br>
		Musica domani, musica/realt&agrave;, 1985 La musica, Rivista IBM, Perspectives of New<br>
		Music). I wrote the book Computer Music - Manuale di informatica musicale. In the<br>
		domain of informatics I realized Hypermusic, a didactical software for music<br>
		self-learning, and WCShell, a packages of programs to write, edit, generate and<br>
		mantain Csound orchestras and scores (and other). Since 1983 to 1991 I<br>
		collaborated with RAI-Radiotre (Italian State Radio) to produce contemporary<br>
		music broadcasting and concerts; among them Forum internazionale (with James<br>
		Dashow), a weekly bradcast on the whole world contemporary music. In 1977 I<br>
		founded and conducted in Milan ensemble edgar var&egrave;se, a chamber group which<br>
		repertory sapnned from Venetian &#145;500 to contemporary music, and since 1992 I<br>
		founded and I am conducting Farfensemble, a similar chamber group. My<br>
		compositions &nbsp;have been played or broadcast in Italy, France, Germany, Sweden,<br>
		Finland, USA, Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay and Australia. &nbsp;They are published and<br>
		recorded by publishers EDIPAN and BMG-Ariola. I am a member of the Direction af<br>
		the association &nbsp;Musica Verticale (http://www.axnet.it/musvert) and of National<br>
		Commitee for musicology (Italian Ministery of School and University). I lives and<br>
		work in Montopoli di Sabina, 30 miles north of Rome. My computer skills: FORTRAN,<br>
		6502 Assembler (yes, on my Apple II!), Basic, Visual Basic, C, C++ My hobbies:<br>
		mountain climbing, olive-tree cultivation and olive oil production. My family:<br>
		Ambretta, wife; Pablo (29), Cecilia (18) and Carlotta (14), sons &amp; daughters<br>
