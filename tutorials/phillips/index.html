Okay, I'm off my soapbox, now on to the heart of the matter...</p>	<dl>		<dt><b>Csound</b>		<dd>Csound is a programming language/environment for music composition, sound design, and audio processing. Creating an output soundfile consists of writing and compiling two text-files: the orchestra (orc) file contains the instrument design, and the score (sco) file plays the instrument and provides it with parameter information (the p-fields, i.e., amplitude factors, frequency, note durations, etc). The primary level of activity is the score note statement: however, in Csound the &quot;note&quot; signifies any sonic event, which can be a typically musical note, or it can be a pre-recorded soundfile played in part or entirely. The note event can also represent resynthesized sounds: Csound provides a very nice package of analysis/synthesis utilities, such as the phase vocoder and linear predictive analysis.		<p>Here is a simple Csound orc/sco file combination:</p>		<p>;;; Orchestra file header (<i>test01.orc</i>)</p>		<pre>        sr=22050    ; sample rate        kr=441      ; control rate        ksmps=50    ; number of samples in control period (sr/kr)        nchnls=1    ; number of output channels</pre>		<p>;;; Instrument definitions</p>		<pre>        instr 1kenv1   linseg  0,p3/2,p4,p3/2,0    ; envelope for amplitudeasig1   oscil   kenv1,p5,1          ; oscillator unit generator, sine wave at frequency p5kenv2   linseg  0,p3/2,p4,p3/2,0asig2   oscil   kenv2,p5+55,2       ; sawtooth wavekenv3   linseg  0,p3/2,p4,p3/2,0asig3   oscil   kenv3,p5+110,3      ; square wave        out     asig1+asig2+asig3                      endin</pre>		<p>;;; Score file (<i>test01.sco</i>)</p>		<pre>f1 0 1024 10 1                              ; GEN function #10, creates sine wave tablef2 0 1024 10 1 .5 .3 .25 .167 .14 .125 .111     ; sawtooth wavef3 0 1024 10 1 0 .3 0 .2 0 .14 0 .111           ; square wave;p1 p2   p3   p4   p5i1  0.00 1.50 5000 220  ; instr 1 plays a combined sine/sawtooth/square wave at                        ; amplitude value 5000, 220 cps base frequency, for 1.5 seconds</pre>		<p>These separate files are compiled together so:</p>		<center>			<p>Csound -otest01.wav -W test01.orc test01.sco</p>		</center>		<p>which will then produce the soundfile test01.wav in Microsoft WAV format. At this point that wavefile can be further processed by Csound, or you can edit it with a wave editor.</p>		<p><a href="test01.wav"><img src="test01.jpg"> test01 </a>(<i>67k 22050Hz 16-bit WAV file</i>)</p>		<p>In the next example an amplitude envelope is applied to an existing soundfile:</p>		<p>;;; Orchestra file (<i>soundin1.orc</i>)</p>		<pre>        sr=22050        kr=441        ksmps=50        nchnls=1        instr 1asig    soundin     &quot;test01.wav&quot;,0	; input wavefile, starts at 0.00 secs,                                                         ; will play for duration of p3kenv    linseg      0,p3/12,1,p3/12,0,p3/12,.95,p3/12,0,p3/12,.90,p3/12,0,p3/12,.85,p3/12,0,p3/12,.80,p3/12,0,p3/12,.75,p3/12,0    ; 12-stage amplitude envelopeaout     =          asig*kenv          ; applied to soundfile        out         aout               ; and out...        endin</pre>		<p>;;; Score file (<i>soundin.sco</i>)</p>		<pre>;p1 p2   p3i1  0.00 1.50       ; Instrument 1 plays the output event (aout) for 1.5 secs</pre>		<p>These separate files are compiled together so:</p>		<center>			<p>Csound -o soundin1.wav -W soundin1.orc soundin1.sco</p>		</center>		<p>which will then produce the soundfile soundin1.wav in Microsoft WAV format. Again, the wavefile can now be further processed by Csound, or edited in a wave editor such as Cool Edit.</p>		<p><a href="soundin1.wav"><img src="soundin1.jpg"> soundin1 </a>(<i>67k 22050Hz 16-bit WAV file</i>)</p>		<p>Finally, here's an example illustrating the use of the phase vocoder. The analysis file is prepared by using the utility <i>pvanal</i>, then resynthesized using the pvoc unit generator:</p>		<p>;;; Orchestra file (<i>pvc01.orc</i>)</p>		<pre>        sr=22050        kr=441        ksmps=50        nchnls=1        instr 1ktim    linseg	0,p3/2,3.00,p3/2,0      ; file to play until end, then backwards to beginningkfmod   linseg	2.0,p3/2,.50,p3/2,1.75  ; a sweeping pitch envelopeasig    pvoc	ktim,kfmod,&quot;test01.pvc&quot; ; fileplay and pitch envelopes applied to analysis fileaout    =       asig        out     aout		endin</pre>		<p>;;; Score file (<i>pvc01.sco</i>)</p>		<pre>;p1 p2   p3i1  0.00 3.00       ; Instrument 1 plays the output event (aout) for 3 secs</pre>		<p>These files are compiled together so:</p>		<center>			<p>Csound -o pvc01.wav -W pvc01.orc pvc01.sco</p>		</center>		<p><a href="pvc01.wav"><img src="pvc01.jpg"> pvc01 </a>(<i>129k 22050Hz 16-bit WAV file</i>)</p>		<p><i>Note</i>: When downloading Csound, be sure to retrieve the documentation. Csound is a complex program, and getting the most from it will require that you read the manual. You should also refer to the Csound Front Page for more information.</p>		<li><a href="ftp://ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/">Csound source &amp; executables</a>		<li><a href="http://www.csounds.com/">Csound Front Page</a>		<li><a href="http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound/hypertext/manual.htm">The On-line Hypertext Csound manual</a>		<dt><b>Cool Edit</b>		<dd>There are many fine wave editors available for Windows, but Cool Edit is surely the most powerful and cost-effective of them all. It is extremely easy to use (I have yet to read the manual), and is very well-equipped with a variety of processing options. Typical cut/copy/paste operations are fully supported, as well as merge and &quot;paste special&quot; options, but the real fun begins with the Transforms. Amplify, Reverse, Normalize, and Channel Mix are fairly common features: Cool Edit also provides Noise Reduction, Compression, a variety of programmable reverbs, flanges, and delays, a simple but useful synthesizer, and even a Brainwave Synchronizer (!).		<p>Soundin2.wav was made by processing soundin1.wav (from the second Csound example above) with transform options in Cool Edit. Processing included time and frequency domain alterations, loop copy &amp; paste, amplitude normalization and fade, and the old &quot;reverse/add reverb/reverse again&quot; trick.</p>		<p><a href="soundin2.wav"><img src="soundin2.jpg"> soundin2 </a>(<i>186k 22050Hz 16-bit WAV file</i>)</p>		<li><a href="http://www.syntrillium.com/cool.htm">Cool Edit</a>		<dt><b>Csounder and SoftSamp</b>		<dd>...are two shareware programs from the good fellows at Omnids. Csounder is a front-end for Csound: orc &amp; sco files are selected from parallel lists, edited, and compiled all within Csounder itself. Easy access to the soundfile analysis tools is also provided, and wavefiles can be played back from Csounder, or you can call your favorite wave editor directly. SoftSamp is a unique program which utilizes Csound's <i>loscil</i> unit generator, in effect making your computer a software sampling synthesizer. Samples are laid out across a keyboard map, then a MIDI file is used as an event source, and finally your sample layout and MIDIfile are compiled into a stereo soundfile (WAV format).		<p>In SS01.wav, test01.wav was used as a sound-source for a quick scale passage.</p>		<p><a href="ss01.wav"><img src="ss01.jpg"> SS01 </a>(<i>119k 22050Hz 16-bit WAV file</i>)</p>		<p><i>Note</i>: Both Csounder and SoftSamp require Csound, so you will need to download and properly install Csound before these programs will work.</p>		<li><a href="http://www.omnids.com">Csounder and SoftSamp</a>		<dt><b>What about a soundcard ?</b>		<dd>These programs should all work with any common Windows-compatible soundcard. I use the PAS16 from Media Vision, while other users report good results from the SoundBlaster and Gravis Ultrasound cards. Provided your card is setup properly you should have no problems playing soundfiles created and edited by these programs.		<dt><b>&quot;Say, Dave, where did you get those neat little graphics ?&quot;</b>		<dd>The spectrograms (amplitude waveforms above spectral displays) were created with freeware by <a href="mailto:rshorne@delphi.com">rshorne@delphi.com</a>. The images were resized and modified in <a href="http://world.std.com/~mmedia/lviewp.html">LViewPro</a>.		<dt><b>Profound thanks to:</b>		<dd>		<pre>    Barry Vercoe at MIT for Csound itself    John Fitch at Bath UK for the PC versions    David Johnston at Syntrillium Software for Cool Edit    Dustin Barlow and Tim Mielak at Omnids for Csounder and SoftSamp</dl></pre>	<p><i><b>&quot;Not the soapbox again !&quot;</b></i><br>	Please note that while Csound is freeware, Cool Edit, Csounder, and SoftSamp are shareware. Be sensible: if you use these programs a lot, register with their creators. These tools are very powerful, in many cases even going beyond what similar commercial programs offer. So, do the right thing already, okay ?</p>	<p>	<hr>	</p>	<center>		<p><a href="http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/index.html">The Home Page...</a></p>		<p><a href="http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/dp_linux.html">The Linux Page...</a></p>		<p><a href="http://www.bright.net/~dlphilp/dp_music.html">The Music Collection...</a></p>	</center>	<p>	<hr>	</p>	<center>		<p><a href="mailto:dlphilp@bright.net">dlphilp@bright.net</a></p>	</center>	<p>	<hr></body>
