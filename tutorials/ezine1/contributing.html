Articles should include somewhat more technical detail than a Keyboard or Electonic Musician article but need not be as formal as a Computer Music Journal article. The tone of the articles should be casual and familiar. I do not expect this magazine to approach the rigor of a scientific journal but rather it should be an entertaining guide to the world of audio experimentation. An article for one of the columns should be 1-3 pages long and should describe a single topic or instrument. Columns will not be that much different than a descriptive email post with the addition of pictures, graphs, equations and possibly sound files. A feature article should be 3-5 pages long and may discuss a topic which does not fit into the other categories.</font></p>		<p><font size="2">Articles can be in either html format or MSWord format. Articles should include functional Csound code examples. Please include graphs or pictures when appropriate as either gif's or jpg's. Sound samples can be included as either .au, .aiff, .wav or mp3. Please include equations when appropriate as either gif's or jpg's. Please try to limit the size of each article to not more than 1 megabyte. Please do not email files larger than 1 megabyte to me. Contact me and I will arrange how to transfer the files. Your name and email adress will be published with the article. Csound magazine will be published quarterly. Back issues will remain available on the web as long as space allows it. Contributors will not be paid and the magazine will not have any advertisements. The deadline for the first issue will be December 15, 1998. The first issue will be made available on the official web site on January 1, 1999. The deadline for the second issue will be March 15, 1999. The second issue will be made available on April 1, 1999.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Copyrights</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">You must own the copyright for the material that is to be published. You will retain your own copyright to republish the article as you wish but you must grant Csound Magazine permission to publish the material as well. It is likely that the first two issues of this magazine will be included on the CDROM of the upcoming MIT press Csound book edited by Richard Boulanger due to be published in the spring.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Topics</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">The columns are presented below. These general categories will be in each issue of the magazine. There will also be a features section. This section will include articles longer than the columns section or on a topic which does not fit into any of the below categories. Some issues of the magazine may have a specific focus on a single topic.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Beginners Section</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will be targeted at the Csound novice and will provide information on things like creating very simple orchestras and scores and examining individual opcodes. Please include the orchestra, score and block diagrams for contributing articles. Some possible topics could be oscillators, envelopes, filters, fm synthesis or others.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Synthesis</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will present novel or conventional synthesis techniques. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument is appropriate for this type of article. Some possible topics might be analog modeling, digital waveguide modeling, granualr synthesis, unusual tone generators or others.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Sound Processing &amp; Sound Effects</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will present novel or conventional sound processing techniques. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument or effect is appropriate for this type of instrument. Some possible topics for this section might be filtering theory, reverb, pitch shifting, chorusing/flanging/phasing, digital delay or others.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Real-Time Csound</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will present an example of using Csound in real time. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved, any special command line options and processor or operating system requirements. Some possible topics might be a description of instrument optimization, selecting optimum command line options, description of MIDI related opcodes or others.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Inside Csound</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will take a detailed look at the C side of Csound. Topics might include adding opcodes to Csound, how reinit works or a description of other Csound internal functionality. </font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Featured Composition</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">A composer's perspective of the composition should be presented. Compositions should be around 1-5 minutes in length. They may be presented as an orchestra and score or as an MP3 file. Compositions will be made available on the web as MP3 files. Csound should have been used for &gt;50% of the composition.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Editorial</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will be reserved for such heated discussion areas as converting C to C++, creating a new language Csound++ or other topics of controversial nature. This will be an opportunity to make your point in a well thought out manner.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Announcements</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">This section will be for software and book announcements and updates. Try to describe the product and any special hardware or software requirements. Include screen shots and images where appropriate.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Interviews </font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">If someone is good at writing interview questions let me know and I will try to obtain interviews with some of the major players in the Csound community.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Resources &amp; Links</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">A list of links for other Csound resources on the web. A large list of links will not be maintained at this site. A few essential links will be included.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">Cover Art</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">I am looking for audio related artwork or artwork by Csound users.</font></p>		<p><strong><font size="2">References</font></strong></p>		<p><font size="2">I expect a few web links and possibly some suggested reading will be sufficient for references. Footnoting and detailed references are acceptable.</font></p>		<p></p>		<p></p>		<p></p>		<p><font size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>		<p><font size="2">Hans Mikelson </font></p>		<p><font size="2">Csound Magazine Editor</font></p>		<p><font size="2">November 11, 1998</font></p>	</body></html>
