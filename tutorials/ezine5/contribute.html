Word format is also acceptable.&nbsp; Sound samples can be included as either .au, .aiff, .wav or mp3.&nbsp; The articles should be informal although a few equations are usually helpful in understanding things. Csound Magazine will be published quarterly.&nbsp; Csound Magazine is hosted by cSounds.com.</p>					<p><strong>Copyrights</strong></p>					<p>You must own the copyright for the material to be published.&nbsp; You will retain your own copyright to republish the article as you wish but you must grant Csound Magazine permission to publish it as well.</p>					<p>The topics I will be considering are presented below.&nbsp; I am open to other topics as well.&nbsp; Please do not email files larger than one megabyte. Contact me and I will arrange how to transfer the files.&nbsp; Remember to include your name and email address with the article.</p>					<p><strong>Editorial</strong></p>					<p>This section has turned into a place for me to ramble. Guest editorials would be welcomed for such heated discussions as converting Csound to C++, creating a new language Csound++ or other topics of controversial nature.</p>					<p><strong>Beginners</strong></p>					<p>This section will be targeted at the Csound novice and will provide information on things like creating very simple orchestras and scores and examining individual opcodes. Please include the orchestra, score and block diagrams for contributing articles.</p>					<p><strong>Synthesis</strong></p>					<p>This section will present novel or conventional synthesis techniques. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument is appropriate for this type of article.</p>					<p><strong>Sound Processing &amp; Sound Effects</strong></p>					<p>This section will present novel or conventional sound processing techniques. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved. Discussion of a single instrument or effect is appropriate for this type of instrument.</p>					<p><strong>Real-Time Csound</strong></p>					<p>This section will present an example of using Csound in real time. Articles should include block diagrams, example orchestra &amp; score, a description of the theory involved, any special command line options and processor or operating system requirements.</p>					<p><strong>Featured Composition</strong></p>					<p>This section should provide a description of the composition. Compositions should be around 1-5 minutes in length. They may be presented as an orchestra and score or as an MP3 file. Csound should be used for &gt;50% of the composition.</p>					<p><strong>Internals</strong></p>					<p>This section will take a detailed look at the C side of Csound. Topics might include adding opcodes to Csound, how reinit works or explore other Csound internals.</p>					<p><strong>Cover Art</strong></p>					<p>I would welcome any audio related art work.</td>			</tr>		</table>	</body></html>
