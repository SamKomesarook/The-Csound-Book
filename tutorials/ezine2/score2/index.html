It seems that Csound users will go to great lengths to avoid writing score entries line by tedious line, and a number of clever dodges (no pun intended) have been devised to ease that terrible burden.</font></p>		<p><font size="2">I exaggerate, of course, and it is only fitting that we use the computer itself as a composing tool in its own right. In the interest of facilitating access, here is a list of applications which generate and/or massage Csound scores. The brief descriptive comments are based solely upon my limited use of the software, and the reader is encouraged to download the software, compile it if necessary, run it if you can, and provide the authors with praise or sorely-needed constructive criticism.</font></p>		<p><font size="2">Before going further I should point out that Csound already has its own score generator/masseuse, the <b>Cscore</b> library. It is an excellent tool for creating new scores or manipulating existing ones, but it does require some knowledge of the C programming language along with a development environment. Its usage is detailed in the Csound manual, with some instructive examples.</font></p>		<p><font size="2">About the screenshots: there aren't any on this page. I'd rather you click on the URLs and check out whatever interests you. Not all of these programs have a GUI anyway, but that doesn't make them less powerful.</font></p>		<p><font size="2">The applications listed run under the Linux operating system. I have indicated when versions are available for other systems, but perhaps a worthy contributor will provide Hans with another article for the 'zine, one focused on similar applications for Windows or the Mac OS. And so, with that understanding, on to the software... </font></p>		<p><strong>Cecilia</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://www.musique.umontreal.ca/electro/CEC/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">Cecilia</font></a><font size="2"> </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2"><b>Cecilia</b> truly deserves its own article, but I mention it here because of its <b>Cybil</b> score processing language, another wonderful feature of this award-winning software from Jean Pich&eacute; and Alexandre Burton. Here is their description of the language in the documentation: </font></p>		<blockquote>			<p><font size="2">Cybil is a score specification language that generates standard Csound numeric note lists according to a simple yet powerful syntax. A Cybil score is pre-processed each time a Csound computation is launched. Cybil can easily generate thousands of note events with just a few instructions but computation can be slow for lengthy scores. </font></p>		</blockquote>		<p><font size="2">The distribution includes a number of Cybil-produced scores. They are quite impressive, yet the language is compact and easy to learn.</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> hopefully anything that supports </font><a href="http://www.scriptics.com" target="_top"><font size="2">Tcl/Tk</font></a><font size="2"> </font></p>		<p><strong>Ceres</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="ftp://mustec.bgsu.edu/pub/linux/" target="_top"><font size="2">Ceres</font></a><font size="2"> Oyvind Hammer's original </font>			<li><a href="ftp://mustec.bgsu.edu/pub/linux/" target="_top"><font size="2">Ceres2</font></a><font size="2"> Johnathan Lee's enhanced version </font>			<li><a href="ftp://mustec.bgsu.edu/pub/linux/" target="_top"><font size="2">Ceres2w</font></a><font size="2"> WAV and <i>glibc</i> support for <b>Ceres2</b>, from Reine Jonsson </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">The different versions of <b>Ceres</b> can each save a soundfile's spectral analysis data as a Csound score file. Two formats are offered, described in Dr. Hammer's HTML help as follows: </font></p>		<blockquote>			<p><font size="2"><u>Parmerud Csound scorefile</u> </font></p>			<p><font size="2">This specialized export was made for the Swedish composer </font><a href="http://www.aec.at/prix/kunstler/Eaparmerud.html" target="_top"><font size="2">Ake Parmerud</font></a><font size="2">. The frequency axis is divided into a number of &quot;strings&quot;. As soon as the amplitude in a frequency band corresponding to a string exceeds the <i>Trigger</i> value, a new Csound note is written with a duration given by the <i>Resonance</i> value. After a number of seconds (<i>Hysteresis</i>), the string will again enter a trigger mode, waiting for the amplitude to exeed the threshold. </font></p>			<p><font size="2"><u>Csound scorefile</u> </font></p>			<p><font size="2">Sends the complete spectral analysis to a Csound score file. Each line represents a &quot;pixel&quot; as shown in the sonogram, and is formatted as follows: </font></p>			<center>				<p><font size="2">i1 Starting_time Duration Frequency Amplitude </font></p>			</center>			<p><font size="2">Note that &quot;Duration&quot; will always have the same value. </font></p>			<p><font size="2"><i>Warning!</i> The Csound score file may become ***huge***. It is strongly recommended to do a <em>Sieve</em> operation first, to reduce the number of non-zero pixels. </font></p>		</blockquote>		<p><font size="2">My experience has shown that the score file can indeed grow to enormous size. The <em>Sieve</em> operation retains only the N strongest frequency components for each analysis window, and its use is well-advised. Note too that if varying durations are desired a small <b>Cscore</b> program can process the resulting file to good effect. Finally, since <b>Ceres</b> can import PBM images the program provides an indirect &quot;image-to-score&quot; conversion utility.</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> Linux, SGI</font></p>		<p><strong>Matti Koskinen's Csound Utilities</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://www.sci.fi/~mjkoskin/" target="_top">TkScore</a>			<li><a href="http://www.sci.fi/~mjkoskin/" target="_top">rain</a>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">These programs are simple in design, but quite powerful. <b>TkScore</b> concatenates existing Csound scores and WAV-format soundfiles into a single mega-score. An uncluttered interface provides a canvas for laying out arbitrary sequences of scores and soundfiles, represented as colored bars of proportionally varying lengths. The program calls an external version of Csound, and the resulting soundfile can be played in background while the user adjusts the placement of parts on the canvas.</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><b>rain</b> takes any GIF image, applies various user-defined values, and translates it into a Csound score. The engine behind this magic is essentially that found in <b>Ceres</b>, but Matti's implementation handles a more popular image format. <b>rain</b> also has only one focus, making it a good choice for quick conversions.<br>		</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> anything that supports </font><a href="http://www.scriptics.com" target="_top"><font size="2">Tcl/Tk</font></a><font size="2"> </font></p>		<p><strong>MIDIfile to Score</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://www.snafu.de/~rubo/songlab/midi2cs/" target="_top"><font size="2">Midi2Cs</font></a><font size="2"> </font>			<li><a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/rose.html" target="_top"><font size="2">Rosegarden</font></a><font size="2"> </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">Converting standard MIDI files to Csound scores is easy with either of these applications. Ruediger Bormann's excellent <b>Midi2Cs</b> provides a command-line interface which hides a very powerful tool. The list of supported features is too long to place here, so the reader is advised to visit Ruediger's site and read the copious on-line documentation.</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><b>Rosegarden</b> is also feature-rich but with a more complex design and interface. It is a MIDI sequencer, with support for standard MIDI files, and it is also a common-practice music notation editor. MIDIfiles can be imported into the sequencer, displayed and edited in the notation window, and saved as Csound score files if desired. The program's interface is showing its age (a new one based on <b>Gtk</b> is in the works), but it is very easy to navigate, and it does provide a unique and useful tool to Csound composers working with standard notation.<br>		</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> both run on a variety of UNIX machines, <b>Midi2Cs</b> also runs under DOS </font></p>		<p><strong>Silence</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~gogins/" target="_top"><font size="2">Silence for Java</font></a><font size="2"> </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">Michael Gogins describes his <b>Silence</b> as: </font></p>		<blockquote>			<p><font size="2">...an extensible system for making music on computers by means of software alone. It is an instrument for music that could not be performed, composed, or even imagined without computers. It is specifically designed to support algorithmic composition using software synthesis. </font></p>		</blockquote>		<p><font size="2">It excels at realizing and rendering numeric worlds such as Lindenmayer systems, strange attractors, and iterated functions into Csound scores. It also imports GIF images and standard MIDI files. Any and all compositional &quot;nodes&quot; can be freely organized, allowing the creation of very complex scores. </font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> Linux, Windows95/98/NT, hopefully anywhere supporting </font><a href="http://java.sun.com"><font size="2">Java</font></a><font size="2"> </font></p>		<p><strong>HPKComposer</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://hplank.inetpc.com/" target="_top"><font size="2">HPKComposer</font></a><font size="2"> </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">Jean-Pierre Lemoine has here provided Andre Bartetzki's </font><a href="http://www.kgw.tu-berlin.de/~abart/CMaskMan/CMask-Manual.htm"><font size="2">CMask</font></a><font size="2"> with a very useful GUI.

Since I have some minimal C skill I have yet to get into it, so here's what CM's developer Rick Taube has to say: </font></p>		<blockquote>			<p><font size="2"><b>Common Music</b> (CM) is an object-oriented music composition environment. It produces sound by transforming a high-level representation of musical structure into a variety of control protocols for sound synthesis and display: MIDI, Csound, Common Lisp Music, Music Kit, CMix, CMusic, M4C, RT, Mix, VRML and Common Music Notation. Common Music defines an extensive library of compositional tools and provides a public interface through which the composer may easily modify and extend the system. All ports of Common Music provide a text-based music composition editor called Stella. A graphical interface called Capella currently runs only on the Macintosh. See Documentation for more information. </font></p>		</blockquote>		<p><font size="2">So many experienced Csound hands swear by Common Music that I know I'll have to give it some serious time.

I've only run the demo, but it seems powerful: a samples database is combined with a pattern data file to create a Csound score file, very quick and easy. Toby Shepard's <b>drumachine</b> is equally easy to use, but his design model differs: patterns are strung together into &quot;tracks&quot;, very similar to the pattern/song model of many drum machines. Both programs allow arbitrary degrees of rhythmic complexity, while the sounds are limited only by your available collection of soundfiles. Plain, cool Csound software...</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> Linux </font></p>		<p><strong>Tuning The Score</strong></p>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser/rocky.html" target="_top"><font size="2">Rocky</font></a><font size="2"> </font>			<li><a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/" target="_top"><font size="2">Scala</font></a><font size="2"> (<i>Linux version available</i> </font><a href="ftp://ella.mills.edu/ccm/tuning/software/other/"><font size="2">here</font></a><font size="2">) </font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2">Peter Blasser's <b>Rocky</b> is a sequencer for creating Csound scores in 22-tone equal temperament. I haven't got it working completely, but it will generate and export some interesting material. I have only recently received Manuel Op de Coul's <b>Scala</b> for Linux and haven't yet tested it. <b>Scala</b> can access a large library of tunings and the homepage claims that &quot;Exporting scale data to other music software, such as Csound, is straightforward.&quot;<br>		</font></p>		<p><font size="2"><i>Platform availability:</i> for <b>Rocky</b>: Linux, Windows95/98/NT, hopefully anywhere supporting </font><a href="http://java.sun.com"><font size="2">Java</font></a><font size="2">; for <b>Scala</b>: Linux, DOS/Windows, MacOS, OpenVMS, IRIX </font></p>		<p><font size="2">So there you have it.
