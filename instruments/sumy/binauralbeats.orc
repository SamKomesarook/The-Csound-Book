; AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE STUDY OF SOUND LOCALIZATION CONCERNS THE EAR'S ABILITY TO PROCESS
; PHASE DIFFERENCES IN THE EARS. ONE WAY TO STUDY THIS PHENOMENON IS TO PRESENT TWO SINUSOIDS OF
; SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, ONE TO EACH EAR. AT LOW FREQUENCIES THE SOUND MAY APPEAR TO 
; FLUCTUATE OR BEAT SLOWLY AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE FREQUENCY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TONES.
; NOTE THAT THESE "BINAURAL BEATS" ARE QUITE UNLIKE THE PHYSICAL BEATS THAT CAN BE HEARD BY A SIN-
; GLE EAR. THERE, THE SMALL DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO FREQUENCIES CAUSES THE PHYSICAL STIMULUS TO WAX 
; AND WANE IN INTENSITY; IF THIS FLUCTUATION IS SLOW ENOUGH, IT IS EXPERIENCED AS A BEATING SENSA-
; TION. WITH BINAURAL BEATS, HOWEVER, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO TONES OCCURS BECAUSE OF 
; SOME KIND OF INTERACTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE INPUTS FROM EACH EAR.
; ONE MIGHT EXPECT THAT THESE BINAURAL BEATS WOULD OCCUR ONLY AT LOW FREQUENCIES, SINCE AT HIGHER
; FREQUENCIES IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN PRESERVE THE TEMPORAL STRUC-
; TURE OF THE WAVEFORM AT EACH EAR, A CONDITION THAT MUST BE MET FOR THEIR INTERACTION TO BE NOTICE-
; ABLE. THIS CONJECTURE IS SUPPORTED BY QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS (LICKLIDER, WEBSTER, AND HEDLUN, 
; 1950). THEY FOUND THAT THE BEST BINAURAL BEATS  OCCURED AT FREQUENCY SEPARATIONS OF ABOUT 30HZ NEAR
; 400HZ AND MUCH SMALLER FREQUENCY SEPARATIONS AT THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES. NO BINAURAL BEATS ARE EVI-
; DENT ABOVE 1500HZ. TOBIAS (1965) FOUND THAT MEN APPEAR TO PERCEIVE BINAURAL BEATS AT HIGHER FRE-
; QUENCY THAN WOMAN, BUT THIS NEEDS MORE EXPLORATION.
; IN THIS DEMONSTRATION A 250HZ TONE IS PRESENTED TO THE RIGHT EAR, WHILE 251HZ TONE IS PRESENTED TO
; THE LEFT EAR.
