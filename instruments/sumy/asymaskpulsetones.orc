
;******************   ASYMMETRY OF MASKING BY PULSED TONES   ********************
; A PURE TONE MASKS TONES OF HIGHER FREQUENCY MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN TONES OF LOW-
; FREQUENCY. THIS MAYBE EXPLAINED BY REFERENCE TO THE SIMPLIFIED RESPONSE OF THE
; BASILAR MEMBTRANE FOR TWO PURE TONES A AND B.
; THIS DEMONSTRATION USES TONES OF 1200HZ AND 2000HZ, PRESENTED AS 200MS TONE
; BURSTS SEPARATED BY 100MS. THE TEST TONE, WHICH APPEARS EVERY OTHER PULSE, DE-
; CREASES IN 10 STEPS OF 5DB, EXCEPT THE FIRST STEP WHICH IS 15DB.
