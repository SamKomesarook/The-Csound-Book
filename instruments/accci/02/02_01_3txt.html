An exponentially decaying envelope is set onto anumber of sinusoid waveforms. In the first sound, all frequency components decay synchronously.The spectrum is invariant and recalls an electronic chime.For the second tone, the same frequency components have a decaytime approximately inversely proportional to their frequency: theprinciple is followed in a flexible manner to come to a moreintricate decay pattern.  Compared to the first sound, we findmore life and naturalness here.The next tone features a different set of frequencies, again withnon-synchronous decay.  The last four tones overlap and their frequency components are sufficiently close to each other to produce beats. (Risset 1969: #420)</pre>	</body></html>
