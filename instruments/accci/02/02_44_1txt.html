In this realization the soundappears to descend infinitely. (Shepard 1964: pp. 2346-53; Risset1969b: p. 88)10 parallel units perform the same calculations, but not at thesame time!  Amplitude and frequency envelopes of the parallelbuilding blocks differ in phase by 1/10th of a cycle.  The frequencies follow an exponential decay, from ifq=3900 toifq=3900*2-10.  This equals a descent over 10 octaves from thestart to the end of the 120 second note event. The phase difference spaces the frequency components exactly oneoctave apart.  Thus, an octave descent takes 120s/10 = 12 secondshere. The bell-shaped function f71 controls all amplitudes with theeffect of enhancing the frequency trajectory of components in themid-frequency range, and attenuating low and high frequencycomponents.  The lowest and highest frequencies are inaudible. Interpolating oscillators are recommended to avoid noticeablenoise or discontinuities due to round-off errors.  More in generalthis holds for all sounds that include frequency modulation.(Mathews 1969: p. 134; Moore 1977: pp. 26-29, 1985: pp. 326-334)A sinus starting at 270 degrees (+1,/2) eliminates the additionalstep of abusing an audio file to generate a bell-shaped function.(Risset 1969: #513)</pre>	</body></html>
