Originally, the score file has been createdwith the help of a PLF sub routine (Mathews 1969: pp.78-86).Slightly different routines were used on each of the three two-note groups (<a href="02_01_5_tif.gif.html">indicated by brackets in the figure</a>).4 harmonics for group 1, 8 harmonics for group 2 and 10 harmonics for group 3 are generated in turn. <a href="02_01_5_fb.gif.html">The durations of the successive harmonics are related to the</a><a href="02_01_5_fb.gif.html">fundamental note duration D by D-DD.</a>If DD = 0, they have the same duration as the fundamental, asshown to the right.  The total duration of the sound for Nharmonics is then given by: D(total) = D + N * TS. For generation routine 2 the pattern is slightly different with DD &gt; 0.The envelope has a parabolic attack and decay.  This shape iscreated by the linear f31 multiplied by itself.  The generaldesign is additive. (Risset 1969: #500)</pre>	</body></html>
