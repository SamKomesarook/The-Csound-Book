The rise time for the fundamental is 10 or 30 msec,its steady state is 0 or 30 msec, and its decay is set to1.6 seconds.  The remaining two EXPSEG modules ensure a fast decayouts1of the inharmonic partials.  In this example, the set of partialstake .6 and .3 seconds respectively to decay to 1/1000th of theirinitial amplitude.The pitch evolution is following the functions f31 (stays thesame), f32 (increasing about a third), f1 (sinus with anamplitude of a third) and f33 (decreasing a third).The examples are ordered in the same sequence.  The last tone isto demonstrate the degenerate effect of a long rise paired with avery brief decay of the inharmonic contributors. (Risset 1969:#440)The instrument can also be classified in main group 03.  Thiswould underline the functional difference of the oscillators.Nevertheless, we prefer to focus on the technical parallelism ofthe design.</pre>	</body></html>
