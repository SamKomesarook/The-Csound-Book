The envelope produces a large and fast increase ofthe amplitudes in the rise.  Both for instruments 02_13_1 and02_13_1B the rise time itself is 50 msec.  It is somewhat largerthan in most actual trumpet sounds because of the unusual way inwhich the harmonics enter.Risset adds here that these sounds are not presented as goodimitations of trumpet sounds.  There is no formant structure,there are not enough components and there is no frequencycontrol.  Yet, he points out, this design is not limited tobrass-like sounds, and can be useful in other contexts. The <a href="02_13_1x.gif.html">figure of the harmonic scheme</a> shows that below an amplitude of 33 the output will contain no harmonics, while for values between 33 and 50 the number of harmonic components increases to seven.Reaching 50 on the abscissa, all functions are .05.  This can beused as a point of reference, to understand how the quantitiesare distributed in this instrument.  After passing through thesloped linear scaling functions, the amplitudes are multiplied bydifferent amounts, proportional to 1000.  For the second harmonic:1000x.05=50, for the third harmonic: 2000x.05=100 and so on forthe other harmonics.  These amounts function as additional (orsecondary) weighting factors of the harmonics.While all following the LINSEG envelope, above an amplitude valueof 50, the various harmonics increase 2,3 ... 7 times as fast asthe fundamental (according to their harmonic number in thisparticular design). (Risset 1969: #210)For implementations of this type of design, a multiplier beforethe output is used to scale the amplitude to the desired level.Any attempt to scale at an earlier stage would disturb theprecarious balance of this instrument, as will be clear from thedetailed exposition above.</pre>	</body></html>
