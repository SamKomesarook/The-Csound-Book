The tables contain abell-shaped and an exponential function. The variableicycle controls the speed of incremental indexing. Cycle time studies. The score file explores how different values of the variableicycle affect the sound.For the first tone the sampling index advances 1/100th of acycle. In the second tone the index moves at 1/50th and in thelast setting it increases to 1/25th of a cycle. The duration is20 seconds for each note.The bell-shaped function cannot be generated by any of Csound'sGEN routines directly. There is a way though, to obtain a tableof an arbitrary mathematical function by making one extra step. First, a purely mathematical orchestra calculates the tablevalues. After this run, the desired table exists as a datafile.From now on, any instrument can make use of the new table. GEN 01retrieves the values of the soundfile into a function table. Likeall GEN routines, GEN 01 by default rescales the given values tothe range (-1 &lt;x &lt; 1). loaded into internal memory, the function table can be used like any wave or envelope function table. In instrument 02_44_2, the datafile sflib/88_01_2.tab is called up by gen 01 to give the bell-shaped function. A subdirectory sflib (SoundFileLIBrary) within the main soundfile directory is useful to protect mathematical and other special audio files from wildcard operations on the soundfile directory.
