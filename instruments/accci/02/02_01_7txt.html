In his score the composer uses only three parallel building blocks, but this can be extended to any number, if there is a wish to do so.  In section 1 the waves with the higher harmonic content decay faster.  This situation is often encountered in natural vibrating systems.  The example of section 2 adds a slight detuning to add liveliness.  In section 3, the waves with lower harmonic content decay first (not often found in nature), and section 4 adds a small detuning once more.  The noise in sections 3 and 4 stemsfrom the foldover components of the square wave f31.  Section 5repeats section 1, and the last section detunes the threeoscillators just a little more than was the case earlier on.(Risset 1969: #300)</pre>	</body></html>
