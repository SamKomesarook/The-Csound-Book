		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
The additive synthesis instruments of this main group are
assembled from equal building blocks.  Apart from different data
fed to these designs, the instruments differ in their methods of
controlling the envelope and waveform.  Sometimes the addition is
directed from within the score file by using a note statement for
each harmonic.  This is a very flexible method that allows to vary
the amount of harmonics with every event.  On the other hand the
hardcoding of a constant number of parallel basic instrument
blocks is more economical. 

Again, some of Risset's fine instruments adorn this part of the
catalog.  The composer has written his thesis on trumpet tones
and extensively used additive designs in his compositions.  He
points out that instrumental imitation is not aimed at
duplicating an instrument, but at shedding light on properties
that can endow sounds with naturalness, richness and character.
The brass timbre, for example, is characterized by a law of
variation between physical parameters, rather than by a physical
invariant such as a spectrum (Risset 1989: p. 68).
