The range of the random variation of grain pitch is one semitone above and below the base pitch.  The minimum inter-grain time is 20 ms and the maximum inter-grain time is 100 ms. Grain length can varybetween 20 and 50 ms. The grain envelope is defined by function number 39.The second section will produce eight streams with a good deal of grain overlap.  The minimum inter-grain time and maximum inter-grain times are reduced to one and ten milliseconds respectively in order to increase grain density.  The bandwidth of random variation around A is reduced to plus or minus one quarter tone.The grain overlap is a result of using different seed values for each call of Csound's pseudo random number generator [randh].  Introducing some random variation into grain length and inter-grain time minimizes the amplitude modulation inherent togranular synthesis.</pre>	</body></html>
