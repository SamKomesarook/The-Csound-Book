For purpose of demonstration, the grains are drawn from a C major scale which was created using a simple FM setup.The read pointer marks the location in the sample where the currentgrain begins.  If the read pointer moves forward through the sample and the grain density is sufficiently high, a sort of granular resynthesis results.  This is the case in the first section of the score.  The rate at which the read pointer moves through the sample is entirely flexible.  It can move forward, backward or remain stationary.  In the second section it moves through the sample at a rate whichis ten times as long as the sample's length.  This results in a granular resynthesis which is ten times as long as the original whilestill retaining the pitch of the original sound file.It is not necessary for the grains to begin exactly at the position of the read pointer.  This instrument also utilizes a definable amount of random variation of start time around the read pointer.  In the third section the read pointer acts as the mean of a window within which a start point is randomly selected.  Given sufficient grain density, this results in a 'blurring' of the original sound.</pre>	</body></html>
