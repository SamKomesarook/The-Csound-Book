		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>

The basic statement of the Fourier theorem is that any complex 
periodic sound may be represented by a sum of sinusoids of infinite
duration.  While this works well for a number of applications, the 
Fourier theorem also has some limitations, eg. the constituent sine 
waves ideally are to have an infinite duration.  
 
Granular Synthesis proposes to replace the sine wave as basic 
building block by another fundamental unit, the acoustical quantum
or smallest event activating the auditory system - as proposed
by physicist Dennis Gabor in 1947.  The acoustical grain is a miniature
sound, typically with a duration around 10 or 20 ms, but these
limits may be extended to 1-100ms.  A grain or acoustical quantum 
has an envelope and waveform. The latter may be synthesized or sampled.  

Many grains per second are accumulated to define an acoustical event.
Instead of specifying each grain's envelope and waveform data on a
one-by-one basis, a host of other strategies have been devised.  Grain density,
rates of change for various parameters, bandwidth for pitch and other 
parameters are some examples for 'intermediate variables' trying to cover 
the ground between micro and macro level of sound.
 
Subgroup 01 features an entirely flexible way to approach granular
synthesis, not through the use of a specifically built Csound unit
generator, but solely constructed with the help of Csound modules
for program flow control: TIMOUT and REINIT.  The flexibility of this 
approach and the effective implementation make these instruments a 
useful starting point for exploring the basics of granular synthesis.
