		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
In its simplest form the algorithm consists of averaging each two
successive samples of a circular buffer (or wave-table), and then
writing the average back to the buffer as the new sample value.
The various harmonics of whatever initial spectrum are decaying
to an almost pure sine wave, but at different rates. 
The initial buffer values are chosen as a function of the desired
sound type.  Plucked strings, with high partials, are best
obtained if the circular buffer is filled with random values.  As
these are periodically repeated, the result is not noisy or
hissing and, without decay algorithm, sounds like a reed organ.
With the decay algorithm, it will sound like a plucked string.
Using a different random buffer for each note adds a small
variation to notes of the same pitch, resulting in even more
natural sounding tones. 
                        
The implementation of the algorithm Y<sub>t</sub> = 1/2(Y<sub>t-p</sub>+Y<sub>t-p-1</sub>) is made
extremely efficient by use of bit shifting operators.
Multiplication is not necessary.  Thus the technique can provide
impressive real-time performance without loss of quality.
(Karplus et al. 1989: pp. 467-480)

The process of averaging can be further specified by stretching
the process in time, adding a roughness factor to control the
range between pitch and noise, or combinations of both. (Jaffe et
al. 1989: pp. 481-494)
