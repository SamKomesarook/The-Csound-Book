The technique is frequently used by musicians andreferred to as harmonic enveloping.Care has to be taken to choose the correct scaling factormediating between amplitudes and bandwidths.  In this case thebandwidth is 10% of the amplitude value of the tones.  Somedifferent amplitudes values are presented in the score, rangingfrom 4000 to 160000.Note also: If RESON is used as a low pass filter (icfq=0), theactual cutoff frequency of the filter will be .707 times thevalue of kbw.</pre>	</body></html>
