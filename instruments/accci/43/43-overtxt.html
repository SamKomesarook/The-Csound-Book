		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
BUZZ and GBUZZ are pulse generators and provide yet another means
of effectively generating a complex audio signal. Using the
closed form of a sum of sinusoids, only two oscillators are able
to produce a complex wave of N partials. In the case of BUZZ, it
is a set of harmonically related cosine partials of the
fundamental frequency ifqc. For their spectral richness, pulse
generators are particularly useful as sources in subtractive
synthesis designs.

BUZZ is a special case of the more general GBUZZ in which all
harmonics are equally strong, and the series starts with the
fundamental. 

In GBUZZ one can chose an exponential coefficient multiplier
'kratio' to envelope the harmonic spectrum (One cannot use the
variable 'kr' for this ratio, as suggested in the Csound manual;
'kr' is a reserved symbol) of the output. Also GBUZZ allows to
specify a lowest harmonic 'klh' different from the fundamental
frequency. 

A pulse train is obtained by extending the number of harmonics up
to the Nyquist frequency. This is done by making the number of
harmonics frequency dependent: 

                  knh = int (sr/2/ifqc).

In general pulse waveforms have a significant amplitude only
during a short interval of time (pulse width).
Repeated periodically, the pulse waveform yields rich spectra,
depending on period and shape of the pulse. The pulse width gets
narrower with increasing number of harmonics in the spectrum.
