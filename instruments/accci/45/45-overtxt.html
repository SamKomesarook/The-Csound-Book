		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
Designed in the first place for rich vocal imitation, and
developed from the CHANT program, the FOF unit generator
produces a complex, periodic signal with one spectral formant
region. 

FOF's model is closely related to the source/filter paradigm of
natural instruments and the voice: a complex source is
amplified by a complex resonator. On the other hand, FOF 
produces series of very short, often overlapping excitations,
that can be considered to be granules. (Clarke, J.M. 1988)</pre>
