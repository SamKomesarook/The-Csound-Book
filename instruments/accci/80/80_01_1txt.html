The effect of the RANDI unit is negligible.Instrument 2 (see right figure) produces a slightly amplitudemodulated sinus tone, whose frequency is controlled by two linearfunctions.  One of these functions does nothing (!).  This incontrast to f9, which brings in a frequency rise of 10%, from 90%to 100% of the specified frequency (which is really the amplitudeinput of the oscillator).  The function of instrument 2 is partly to emulate the attack portion of a flute tone and partly to enrich the timbre of the complete tone (when playing parallel to instrument 1).For an acoustic impression of the complexity of this design, oneshould listen to the two instruments apart.  The score files80_01_2B.SCO and 80_01_2C.SCO are included in the catalogue tothis end. (Risset 1969: #100; Boulanger 1990: morefiles/risset1.orc)</pre>	</body></html>
