		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
The ACCCI is conceived as an open system, leaving room for new
instruments.  At the same time, it provides a rigorous framework for
experimental sound synthesis, where experiences made by Csound
users can be suitably placed in the catalogue.  Here are our
guidelines: 

   - use the ACCCI number code to classify all files that
     are related to one instrument

   - a main group of the catalog starts with two pages    
     of general information: contents, overview and suggested 
     reading  

   - use the same variable names for the same parameters
     throughout the catalog

   - use a distinct header with name, synthesis group,
     programmer, date and other relevant information (.ORC
     and .SCO files)

   - start the actual instrument by assigning the p-field
     variables to the mnemonic variables, i.e. idur = p3.
     (.ORC files)

   - provide comments clarifying the instrument design 
     (.ORC files)

   - add the mnemonic variables in a comment at the beginning
     of the actual score (.SCO files)

   - keep a textfile (.TXT) with an informal description
     of the instrument design, experimental directions,
     subjective impressions, reference articles, etc.

   - instrument flow charts (.EPS files)
