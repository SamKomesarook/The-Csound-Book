       Computer music as a field has been likened to a            
       building with a sign on it saying &quot;Best Eats in Town&quot;. 
       Many people go into this building expecting to find an     
       elegant restaurant with a parchment menu, formidable wine  
       list, and pleasant, efficient, even charming service.  What 
       they find instead, to their surprise, is a shiny, enormous, 
       extremely modern kitchen, with abundant supplies of every  
       kind of foodstuff in voluminous, refrigerated storage.     
       Indeed, the &quot;Best Eats in Town&quot; are available here, but only 
       for those willing to learn to cook! (Moore et al. 1983)
