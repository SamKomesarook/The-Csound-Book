		<h3>Sampling Rate and Control Rate</h3>
		<pre>
The sampling rate will be set to the 44.1 kHz CD standard.  This is
to ensure ready-to-use programs on different platforms.  We
refrained from the use of K-rate variables in many programs.  As the
computational resources continue to grow, the gains due to the
K-rate/A-rate differentiation decrease.  On the present generation
of personal workstations it is no longer worth the additional
effort, especially when one bears in mind that the differentiation
can lead to losses in audio quality: &quot;.. many instruments sound
significantly different when run at K-rate=A-rate than they do in
'debugging mode', a feature which has caused this author many hours
of consternation.&quot; (Pope 1993: p.38).  Yet, some unit generators do
not accept A-rate inputs, so K-rate remains necessary at times.
