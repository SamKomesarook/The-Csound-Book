		<h3>Naming Conventions: Variables</h3>
		<pre>
- the first letter
The first letter is always i,k or a (or g for global variables) and
specifies the rate of the variable.
 
- the body of the variable name
Mnemonic of their parameter, the following variable names have been
adopted throughout the ACCCI.  Whenever possible, the variable names
used in the MIT Csound manual are respected.

amp    amplitude              form   formant frequency
atss   attenuation ratio      fq     frequency
att    attack                 lh     lowest harmonic
beg    begin                  meth   method of decay
buf    buffer size            mid    middle
bw     bandwidth              mod    modulated signal
cfq    center frequency       nh     number of harmonics
dec    decay                  oct    octaviation
del    delay                  off    offset value
dur    duration               pcf    pitch contr. function
dyn    dynamic index          pch    pitch
env    envelope               sc     scaling factor
f      function table         src    source signal
ff     formant frequency      stsec  start second
fil    file                   tf     transfer function
fn     function number        timpnt time pointer
fund   fundamental frequency  val    value
ind    index                  vib    vibrato

- the last character
To further characterize variable names, we sometimes attach an
extra letter to the end of the variable name, mnemonic of the
function of that particular unit generator.  For example, ifc may be
the function table variable for an oscillator that generates a
carrier signal.  The most frequently attached mnemonics are:

c      carrier                m      modulator
e      envelope               r      random number
i      index                  w      wave 

We also attach numbers to the end of the variable, but they usually
convey less meaning.  In orchestras with many variables of the same
type, numbers are necessary.  The decay time of the 4th envelope
function of an additive instrument is idec4.
