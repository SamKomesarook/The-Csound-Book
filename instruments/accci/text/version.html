<h3>Version 1.2 Changes</h3>

<pre>
For this CD distribution of the catalog I have added some additional 
html coding.  The flowcharts have much enhanced graphics and a couple 
of new instruments have been added since the last release.  In particular
have a look at the brandnew main group 70.  
Thanks to the many people who have encouraged my work in the past. I hope 
you will all continue to find good examples for learning and teaching here.
