		<h3>Naming Conventions: Table Numbers of the F Statement</h3>
		<pre>
Reserving certain table numbers for specific categories of table
generators has several practical advantages.  When assembling big
orchestras from smaller ones, functions will be more readily
adapted to the new environment.  This leads to a more efficient,
faster experimentation or composition.  The convention overloads the
first parameter of the f statement by reserving table numbers 1-30
for carrier waveforms, 31-70 for envelopes and 70-99 for others.
Hence, the number of a GEN function table will additionally
discriminate an oscillator as carrier or envelope generator, and
even add information about the type of wave being used.

Function tables numbers are restricted to a soft limit of 200
(Vercoe 1993b: p.50).  This feature will hopefully disappear in
future Csound updates to facilitate the creation of a larger
function table library with associated graphs.  In practical terms,
any instrument of the catalog will obey the following conventions
of table numbers:

GEN     Table   Function 
number  number  type

10       1-10   harmonic complex 
09      11-20   weighted (in)harmonic, phase-adjustable
11      21-30   buzz
07      31-50   linear 
05      51-70   exponential
01,02   71-80   read into table from file/parameter fields
        81-99   others
