		<h3>Naming Conventions: Files</h3>
		<pre>
A number of data files are associated with each SWSS instrument.
These files are solely differentiated by their filename extension,
but otherwise carry the same name.

.ORC   Csound orchestra file
.SCO   Csound score file
.EPS   Encapsulated Postscript file: flowcharts, functions
.GIF   GIF89a compressed bitmap file: flowcharts, functions for the WWW
.TXT   documentation
.SF    soundfile

The name of the instrument conceals a coded classification, that
divides the corpus of SWSS instruments into main synthesis groups
and their individual subgroups.  The filename is composed of three
different numbers in total, each of which is delimited by the
underscore.  The first number refers the instrument to its main
group, while the second number associates it to a subgroup of its
main group.  The division in two hierarchical levels enables one to
keep track of particular instruments without creating excessive
overhead organization, and is considered a practical and necessary
tool when working with a large number of files.  Within the ACCCI
directory, orchestra and score files are kept in folders, named
after the number code of their main synthesis group.  It was not
necessary, at this stage of the database, to further subdivide the
directory structure into subgroups.  The third number -- ID --
identifies a particular instrument within the main and subgroup.

For example, the file 01_12_1.SF is the soundfile of an instrument
and its name 01_12_1 contains three codes:
 
01     the main group code
12     a subgroup code of main group 01
 1     ID code within subgroup 01_12

Appended letters (e.g.: 01_12_1B) serve to indicate different
versions of the same instrument. 

Our naming convention is made independent of a particular operating
system by restricting the name length to a maximum of eight
characters and by choosing the underscore as delimiter between
number codes.  We would prefer the dot as delimiter -- as it is
commonly encountered in library classifications -- but the dot may
not be used in DOS.
