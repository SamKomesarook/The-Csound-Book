		<h3>The MIT Media Lab Phase Vocoder</h3>
		<pre>
This phase vocoder is split into an analysis and a synthesis
part.  The analysis part is done by the program pvanal.  It
produces a phase vocoder analysis file with the special
file header (see below), including information about the source
sound, analysis framesize and the overlap factor.

Following this header, the analysis data is stored as float, with
magnitudes and frequencies in turn for the first N/2+1 Fourier
bins of each frame.  We wrote a few programs to investigate the
phase vocoder algorithm on its analysis side.

The source codes of these programs are not included here, but
they are shipped with the Internet version of the catalogue.
Written in C and not depending on audio hardware, the programs
work on any Csound platform.  Here is a short summary of their
function.

  -channels [analysis file] 
     reads file, data displayed per channel         
  -frames   [analysis file]
     reads file, data displayed per frame
  -magnitud [analysis file]
     reads file, data displayed per frame,
     above threshold magnitude only
  -wrapped  [analysis file]
     reads file, displays the value of phase
     and intermediate variables on the way to the
     approximated frequency.   

Sample runs of two of these programs are shown on the following
pages.  The data flood is large and illustrates  the need for
specific display programs, adapted to purpose and nature of the
sound material at hand.  The ability to skip a number of analysis
frames can further reduce the stream of data.

The program flow of pvanal gives a crude picture of this
FFT-based phase vocoder, avoiding the necessity to go too deeply
into the intricate network of source files. 

The meaningful part is the FFT loop of pvanal.c, where
amplitude/time values are transformed into amplitude/frequency
values.  The loop functions are found in the source dsputil.c and
the buffers below are central in the this Fourier transform
procedure.  We have looked into the phase/frequency conversion in
greater detail on page 172.  

The interpolation mechanism used by the PVOC unit generator
during re-synthesis has not been covered in this catalogue.  It is
paramount to a fruitful understanding of this synthesis
technique.
