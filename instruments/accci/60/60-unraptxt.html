Duringa pass, the phase difference since the last frame is evaluatedand unwrapped.  The old phase value is saved in buffer OldPh, thenthe unwrapped phase is saved in the main buffer tmpbuf.  Here isone pass:First the phase value resulting from the rectangular to polarconversion is assigned to float variable p:        p = pha[2L*i]                            <a href="60-wrap.txt.html#compare"><strong>see phase</strong></a>Then the phase change since the last frame is computed:        p -= oldPh[i]                           <a href="60-wrap.txt.html#compare"><strong>see diff-p</strong></a>followed by a call of macro MMmaskPhs, p = DELTA phase:                MMmaskPhs(p,z,pi,oneOnPi)The preprocessor has replaced this macro call by:        z = (int)(p*oneOnPi);        p -= pi*(float)(int)((z+((z&gt;=0)?(z&amp;1):-(z&amp;1) ))));In the first statement, the integer z is assigned the value offloat p, scaled by 1/pi.By casting float to integer, all decimals are truncated.  Thesecond statement is far more complex and can best be approachedin a number of small steps.  First we look at the expression<strong>condit</strong>        z + ( (z&gt;=0) ? (z&amp;1) : -(z&amp;1) )         <a href="60-wrap.txt.html#compare"><strong>see condit</strong></a>which consists of a test, an evaluation and an addition.  Theexpression        z&amp;1discriminates between odd and even numbers.  In binaryrepresentation, all odd integers have their bit 0 set.  Therefore,if z is odd, then z&amp;1 = 1.  For even integers z, z&amp;1evaluates to 0 and condit = z.So the conditional test                           z&gt;=0  ?   (z&amp;1): -(z&amp;1)will only have consequences for odd integers.  These can besimplified to the following if-else statement:        If z greater than or equal to 0, then condit = z+1           else condit = z-1                  The net effect of condit is to make all z even: z = n*2. Then the masking/unwrapping is completed by        p = p - pi * condit                     <a href="60-wrap.txt.html#compare"><strong>see masked</strong></a>The value of condit is scaled back by pi and added or subtractedfrom the delta phase p. All p are unwrapped into the principal branchof the inverse tangent function: -pi &lt; p &lt; pi . In the last two statements of UnwrapPhase, the old polar phaseand the unwrapped delta phase p are saved:        oldPh[i] = pha[2L]*i;        pha[2L*i] = p;In this way, the loop works through all the phase values of theFFT frame, and then proceeds to PhaseToFreq.</pre>	</body></html>
