		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
The phase vocoder analyzes and resynthesizes audio signals.  The
underlying analysis-synthesis model assumes in this case that the
signal is well represented by a sum of sinusoids.  Wind, brass,
string, speech and a number of percussive sounds are well
represented by the phase vocoding technique.  Some other
percussive sounds like clicks, or certain signal-to-noise sound
combinations are not well represented as a sum of sinusoids.
(Dolson 1987)

		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<pre>
The program pvanal performs an analysis of a soundfile and writes
the result to an analysis file.  The analysis basically consists
of an FFT, where framesize of the window (a number of consecutive
audio samples) and window overlap factor are optional CL
arguments.  The analysis file will be at least twice as big as the
soundfile and contains alternating magnitude and frequency
values.  This data can be interpreted as sequence of short time
Fourier transforms (per frame) or as the time-varying response of
a bank of narrow bandpass filters (per channel).

		<h4>Modification</h4>
		<pre>
Software can modify frequency and/or amplitude data over the
whole or a partial range of analyzed data. Moore gives a thorough
exposition of programs to implement these possibilities. (Moore
1990: pp.227-263)

		<h4>Synthesis</h4>
		<pre>
The synthesis is done by Csound's unit generator PVOC.  The
original sound can be resynthesized with high fidelity.  More
commonly time and/or frequency modifications are performed during
resynthesis.  In this case, the PVOC unit will interpolate between
given 'stable' points.
