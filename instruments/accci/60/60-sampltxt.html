		<h3>A Sample Session at the Terminal</h3>
		<pre>

The user commands are displayed in text boxes. First we show a
call of pvanal analyzing a speech file of 5 seconds, sampled at
44.1 kHz (2.2 MB). The FFT window has a size of 1024 points and
the overlap factor is 4 by default. The resulting analysis file
speech1.pv1 already occupies 3.5 MB of storage space.

The second and third command illustrate the operation of
'magnitud'. First the program displays the information found in
the file header. After specifying number of frames and threshold
magnitude, analysis data fills the screen. The data resulting
from the first 'magnitud' call is reproduced here. 

It is the _first_ frame of the analyzed speech file. A hard copy
of the complete analysis file occupies 1718 pages! 

The output of the second readfmag call (book: page: 170,171) is
restricted to channels with magnitudes above 3. This greatly
reduces the data flood.
