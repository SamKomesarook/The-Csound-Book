		<h4>Modulation Index and Sideband Amplitudes</h4>
		<pre>
The modulation index I is defined by amplitude and frequency of
the modulating oscillator: I = amp/fq.

The integer k depends on the modulation index and defines the
highest-ordered sideband with a significant amplitude: k = I+1,
with I rounded to the nearest integer value.

The spectrum of FM is thus composed of the sum of components: 
ifqc +- k*ifqm. 

The amplitudes of all components are determined by Bessel
functions. 
</pre>
		<h4>Negative frequencies</h4>
		<pre>
Negative frequencies are reflected into the positive frequency
domain by multiplying their amplitude with -1 (effect of -&atilde;).
Then all components with the same frequency are added. 

                           c:m ratio

1) fundamental
One can compute the fundamental from the lowest possible c:m
ratio (composed of integers with no common factors):

                 fqc:fqm = N1:N2

Then: fqc/N1 = fqm/N2 = fundamental.

2) spectrum
let N1=1, then:

          N2=1   spectrum with all harmonics

          N2=M   every mth harmonic is missing

For N2=1, N2=2 there is a strong effect of overlapping negative
and positive components.

Irrational or large N2 and/or N1 values in the c:m ratios lead to
inharmonic spectra.

example: 5:7  (1:1.4)  sounds close to 
         1:square root of 2 (1:1.4142...)
