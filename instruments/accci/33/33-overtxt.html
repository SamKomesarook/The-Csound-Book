		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
In this main group, we can only represent two out of three main
techniques of amplitude modulation: ring modulation and
&quot;classical&quot; amplitude modulation.  Csound does not have any
provisions (unit generator) for single-sideband modulation. 

In &quot;classical&quot; amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the
modulator is best expressed as a function of the modulation index
'imod' and the amplitude of the unmodulated carrier oscillator. 

For example, let the signals be two sinusoids.

'Imod=0': the amplitude of the modulator is zero and there is no
modulation.  The spectrum gives the carrier.

'Imod=1': 100% modulation, amplitude of the modulator equals the
amplitude of the carrier.  Output contains the carrier frequency
'ifqc' at the original amplitude, and two sidebands at ifqc+ifqm
and ifqc-ifqm, both with a half of the original amplitude. 

Ring modulated signals are obtained by multiplying two signals or
by applying a wave to the amplitude input of a signal generating
oscillator.  In both designs, the original spectrum of the
modulating wave is split in two (or more) identical images above
and below the carrier frequency(ies).  The main difference with
classical AM is that the carrier frequencies do not appear in the
output. (Dodge 1985: p.80-85)

Both techniques require careful treatment of amplitude values:
the multiplication of two amplitudes can easily lead to
out-of-range amplitudes. 

Negative frequencies are reflected into the positive frequency
domain.
