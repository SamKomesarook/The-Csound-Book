The latter sound is perceived as one, yet its tone quality is related to the chord's harmony.Instrument 1 produces the ring modulation chord, by combining asinus with a block wave.  The dominant frequencies are thedifferences between ifqc and ifqm: -576 +1424 / -273 +1727 / -458+3542 / -864 +3136 / -658 +3342  Hz.  These are the fundamentalsof the modulated block wave.The envelope controlling the sinus wave is also controlling thegeneral envelope of the note and the spectral evolution.  At firstthe attack and duration are short (A), then the attack switchesto a crescendo-decrescendo type with a medium duration (B).  Finally, thefrequencies are repeated (273, 455, 576, 648, 864 Hz) ascomponents of a gong timbre with short attack and long duration. Instrument 2 is equal to 02_01_3.  An additive synthesis tonethrough overlapping score calls. (Risset 1969: #550; Boulanger 1990:morefiles/risset4.orc)</pre>	</body></html>
