The amplitudemodulation is applied to two sinus signals, but this isextendable to the wide range of complex carriers and modulators. The amplitude is kept to the same output level in function of achosen imod factor.  In other words: for whatever amount ofmodulation, the amplitude will equal the specifiedvalue iamp.In the second section imod stays at 100% modulation.  The effectof a changing modulator frequency is tested by varying ifqm from150 Hz to 1200 Hz.  It should be noted that in the latter case,the output also contains the reflected &quot;negative&quot; frequencies.Suggestions:Create an electronic &quot;tremolo&quot; with a small 'imod' and subaudioifqm.  For imod=1, subaudio ifqm leads to a strongly pulsatingtone.  As this concerns LFO modulation of amplitude, within theACCCI an electronic tremolo instrument belongs to main group 01and not to main group 33.</pre>	</body></html>
