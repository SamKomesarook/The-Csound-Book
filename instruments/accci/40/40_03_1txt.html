There are separate envelopes for thedistortion index (LINSEG) and the amplitude (f31). The waveshaping part of the instrument runs at ifq*.7071,producing inharmonic partials.  As LINSEG drops sharply, so doesthe richness of the spectrum.  Short after the beginning of thetone, the spectral bandwidth of the waveshaper has reached zeroand all that is left to hear is a simple sinus.The instrument is designed for short durations (.2 sec). In the low frequency range it sounds quite drum like (firstsection), while it gets more pitched in the high frequency range(second section).
