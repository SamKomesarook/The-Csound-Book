		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
An input signal is rotated by 90 degrees counter clockwise so
that its time axis is parallel to the ordinate of the transfer
function. The ordinate of the transfer function represents the
OUT values and its abscissa stands for the IN values. In this
manner all amplitude values of an incoming signal are mapped to
new amplitude values, in strict correspondence with the transfer
function.

A diagonal transfer function (x=y) gives no distortion at all.
The larger the deviations in the slope of a transfer function,
the more radical the spectral changes. An even transfer function
will produce only even harmonics in the output, while odd
transfer functions yield odd harmonics in the distorted signal.
Discontinuities like abrupt jumps or sharp points lead to
harmonically richer spectra than smooth transfer functions.
(Dodge 1985: pp. 128-141)

To calculate specific spectra, the transfer function is
represented as a polynomial of the general form:

           F(x) = d<sub>0</sub> + d<sub>1</sub>x + d<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + ... + d<sub>N</sub>x<sup>N</sup>

For an input sinus at amplitude 1, amplitude values for the
harmonics belonging to each algebraic term of the polynomial are
obtained by multiplying the divisor with the table value(s) for
h<sub>j</sub>. Summing these coefficients for the corresponding power of x
will compute the value of d<sub>j</sub>.
