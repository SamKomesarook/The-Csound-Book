The maximum amplitude valueis in general half the table length of the transfer function.The incoming sinus is translated according to the transferfunction.  For a strict 1:1 linear mapping, the GEN functions inthis example should have been set to maximum ordinate value of256 (instead of 1), plus (not to forget) inhibiting rescaling ofthe table.  Preceding the GEN routine number by a minus signinhibits normalization of the values.  In this example, theordinate is in a range +-1, so the translation will producea normalized signal.  Finally, the multiplier will scale thesignal to the desired maximum amplitude.The first section plays 5 different transfer functions at thesame pitch and amplitude.The three linear ones are shown in the flow chart, a parabolic(diabolic ?) and a cubic function follow.The most interesting tone is produced by f33.  In the end of thenotes, one hears how the timbre melts.  The remaining two sectionplay a dominant 7th chord 'on' that transfer function. (Dodge1985: pp. 130-132)</pre>	</body></html>
