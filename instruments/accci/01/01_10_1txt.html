Since the vibrato rate is durationindependent here, the rate is directly specified by the value ofifq3. The duration dependence (or not) of certain control functionsaddresses a fairly complicated, but common problem encountered insound synthesis.  Recently Desain and Honing have proposedsome interesting solutions that could be implemented in Csound.Score file generating software for instruments that makeextensive use of vibrato could well take advantage of theirmethod. (Desain et al.: 1992)The multiplier just before OUT serves to scale the signal.  Ingeneral this is the way to adjust a signal's overall amplitude toa desired level: the multiplier is the volume button. The first section displays 3 different waveforms: fundamentalsolo, 4 and 6 weighted harmonics.The second section plays a sinus waveform with five differentamplitude envelopes.In the third section, the LFO's frequency is varied from 1 to 5Hz.</pre>	</body></html>
