The object of the comparison here are twotypes of decay and four different durations: middle (2 sec), long(4 sec), short (1 sec) and shorter (.5 sec). Linear decay seems to occur slowly at first and then suddenlydisappears; exponential decay is more even and gives a resonanceimpression.To avoid cutoff during exponential decay, one has to ensure thatthe amplitude controlling function decays to a final value notsmaller than the inverse of the maximum amplitude.  When theabsolute amplitude becomes smaller than 1, the sound is lost inthe quantizing noise.  For instance, if the maximum amplitude is8000, one should have a function decaying to 2(**-13)=1/8192. (Risset 1969: #300) </pre>	</body></html>
