Note that the tempostatement alters the meaning of durations in the score file. Theenvelope varies with duration and the harmonic richness withpitch. This means that we distinguish four kind of notes:1) brief and low (&lt;.2 sec, &lt;250 hz) The function f31 will give a sharp attack. While the first two decay fragments approximate an exponential shape, the third tries to imitate the effect of a damper. The waveform has ten harmonics. 2) brief and high (&lt;.2 sec, &gt;250 Hz) The same envelope f31, but now coupled with a waveform with onlyseven harmonics.(<a href="01_01_1b_fb.gif.html">2 different types of envelopes: brief and long notes</a>)3) long and low (&gt;.2 sec, &lt;250hz) Exponential envelope f51 teams up with a 10 harmonics wave. The envelope minimum of 2(**-6)=&quot;1/64&quot; produces 6/10 of &quot;reverberation time&quot; (time for the level to drop to 60 dB). The durations of the longer notes range typically from .4 to .8 sec. Compared to a real piano (1s at 2000 Hz, up to 10s at 200 Hz), the reverberation times are somewhat shorter here. On the other hand, the discrepancy is lessened by the fact that the initial decay rate in a real piano is higher. 4) long and high (&gt;.2 sec, &gt;250 Hz)The last option is covered by the exponential envelope f51 and a7 harmonics wave.
