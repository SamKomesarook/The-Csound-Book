In SWSS this isrealized in the most general way by two oscillators: the envelopeis generated by setting one oscillator's frequency to 1/idur.This way the oscillator will simply scan a given function tableonce per note, independent of the note duration.  The periodicwaveform is generated according to the <a href="../../../references/manual_html/gen/top.htm">GEN</a> function table whichhas been assigned to the second oscillator.  <a href="../../../references/manual_html/gen/gen09.htm">GEN 10</a> is utilizedfor complex waves with equal strength harmonics.  <a href="../../../references/manual_html/gen/gen09.htm">GEN 09</a> servesto generate complex wavetables, where strengths and ratios of theindividual components are free. <a href="../../../references/manual_html/gen/gen05.htm">GEN 05</a> or <a href="../../../references/manual_html/gen/gen05.htm">07</a> generate exponentialand linear function tables containing discontinuities. Thesefunctions are also successful in serving as waveforms, butfoldover may lead to unwanted quantities of noise in the output.The instrument demonstrates a number of different waveforms:complex waves with between one and eleven harmonics, complexwaves with weighted partials, and a number of linear waveforms(foldover components are negligible at this frequency). Thelinear waveforms are followed by a number of linear andexponential envelopes.  During this display, the wave is heldconstant: linear waveform f42. In the f statements that generate the exponential tables, amaximum value of 10000 had at first lead to a value of .0001 atthe extremes of the table (after rescaling). This very low valueof .0001 resulted in noisy cutoffs. A max value of 1024 (2**10)is better. See also discussion of values for iatdec, instruments01_01_2B and 01_01_5.Some linear time functions and a few wave spectra are shown inthe <a href="01_01_1_fb.gif.html">function tables</a>.</pre>	</body></html>
