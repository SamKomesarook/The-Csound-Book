These contours are scanned at the rate ofthe LFO, which is irate times per note. In this design, irate isduration dependent. Since it is an LFO, frequencies =&lt; 20 hz are required.  Above that limit begins the domain of FM. For f32 and f33, the instrument 01_40_1 coincides with part 2 of #100, see also 1_11_1. One function leaves the frequency unmodified, while the other function furnishes a frequency rise from 90% to 100%.  This type of design enables us to model subtle glissandi and to drive them from within the score file by defining the pitch time function for each note.  Next we display two other linear functions steering frequency.  F37 and f40 are selected from #511 (glissandi with constant frequency differences).  Risset applied very long note durations to this instrument.  Also, the composer lets the glissandoing sounds enter with ca. 1 sec delay from each other.  This way the tones follow the same pitch envelope, the pitch of the first tone is ahead of the pitch of the second while their frequency difference remains constant.  We did not repeat the chase. F38 descends two octaves, f39 ca. a sixth. (Risset 1969: #100, Risset 1969: #511) </pre>	</body></html>
