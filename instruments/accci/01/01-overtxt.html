		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<pre>
Simple Synthesis is probably didactically one of the most
important main groups in the catalogue. It contains basic
building blocks of digital sound synthesis. Different
waveforms, different envelopes, modulation of amplitude or
frequency by low frequency oscillators, chorus effect are the
protagonists in the first act of the ACCCI. Whenever
possible, we have added a historic touch by employing early
examples taken from Risset's Introductory Catalogue.

The literature by De Poli, Dodge, Mathews and Moore contains
valuable general introductions on digital sound synthesis,
functioning of digital oscillators, hard- and software issues.
