The experiment is repeated ata higher random UG frequency.  This increases the noise.  Due tothe design of this instrument, the percentage added to theamplitude in the final output signal is half of the demandedvalue: i.e. 25% output where 50% is specified in the score.The instrument appears in Risset's flute-like passage #100 whichis actually produced by two instruments glued together in themanner of musique concr&egrave;te.  In his comment to the first part ofthis twin design, Risset remarks that the contribution of <a href="../../../references/manual_html/siggen/rand.htm">RANDI</a>to the overall sound is negligible.  The second part of #100 isreproduced as 01_40_1 and the complete flute-like instrument isclassified as 80_01_1. (Risset 1969: #100)</pre>	</body></html>
