			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: There are several reasons. I noticed that Win32 console mode programs are faster than those program that implement graphic interface. Furthermore, it is possible to use another program (there are several Csound launchers and shells available such as Wcshell, VMCI, Visual Orchestra etc.) to make Csound start easier. This allow the user to choose the best interface for his own task.</td>

					<font color="#800040">Q: What computer do I need to run DirectCsound in realtime? </font></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: It depends of how much synthesis power do you need. I recommend at least a Pentium 133 MHz which can handle up to 50 oscillators in real-time (at 44100 Hz). However actual polyphony depends by several factors such as sampling rate, computer motherboard, RAM type, cache memory size and the buffer size you set in the command line call (flag -b).</td>

					<font color="#800040">Q: What about the buffer size: what is the best value I have to set?</font></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#800040">A: </font>It depends mainly by five factors:
					<p>1. Computer speed<br>
					2. Sampling Rate of the orchestra<br>
					3. If you are using the DirectX drivers or the old MME drivers<br>
					4. The type of the soundcard<br>
					5. If a very fast response is needed in your realtime performance.<br>
					<br>
					The trivial rule is: the smallest buffer size it is possible. The problem is that polyphony decreases and the risk of processing underrun increases when buffer size decreases.<br>
					<br>
					A fast computer should allow you to reduce the buffer size, but it is not so intuitive, because in some cases this rule is not followed. For example I have two computer, a slow Pentium 133 and a fast Pentium II 400. So, using DirectX (-+X flag), the minimum buffer size (flag -b) I can set with my P-133 is 100 samples, whereas I have to rise this size up to 200 samples when using my faster P-II 400 with DirectX. I don&#146;t know what is the cause, maybe it resides in the mainboard interrupt configuration of that computer. I tried to play DirectCsound with another Pentium II 233 computer and I have been able to reduce the buffer length down to 50 samples. A person told me that with his Pentium II 400 he can reduce the buffer size down to -b = 16 (practically no &nbsp;delay!!!)<br>
					<br>
					When you are using the old MME (Multi Media Extension) drivers, the buffer should be set at least 4 times bigger than when using DirectX, in the best case. Notice that, differently than when you are using DirectX, you have to set two values: the number of buffers (flag -+p) and the size of buffers (flag -b). These two values depend also by the type of soundcard you use. I noticed that with some rounded sr values such as 40000, the MME buffer can be reduced a lot. When using sr=44100 I have to set the buffer size to about 3000 and the buffer numbers to 8, giving a medium latency time greater than half a second.<br>
					<br>
					I highly recommend to use DirectX for best performance (-+X flag). I haven't implemented DirectX audio input so far, because, unfortunately, my audio card driver doesn't support it at present time. So if you intend to use in realtime audio out and audio in at the same time, you must use old MME drivers for both in and out.<br>
					<br>
					Be aware that DirectCsound does not operate with DirectX in emulation mode, so you need a soundcard certified by Microsoft in order to use DirectX.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: I hope so. Until now each of these versions has its own features. The problem is that John Fitch, the administrator of standard version, moves Csound towards objectives different from those of mine. My main objective and need is to use Csound with realtime controllers (by means of MIDI or other more advanced devices). So my efforts are mainly directed toward transforming Csound into a fast, powerful, interactive and easily controllable performance tool. Part of my code is device dependent, so porting it in other platforms it is not a trivial job. Actually, the efforts of John Fitch are mainly directed towards compatibility in different platform. A recent Fitch&#146;s direction is adding the programming modules of commercial analog synthesizers (such as ADSR envelope, LFO etc.) to Csound. I don&#146;t fully agree with this direction because older opcodes (linseg, expseg and oscil) are already implemented and they are a more powerful superset of the new JPFF opcodes.</td>

					<font color="#800040">Q: What are the main features of DirectCsound in comparison with standard version of Csound?</font></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: There are two kind of features, operating-system-related features, or &#145;core features&#146;, and new opcodes.
					<p>The <b>core features </b>are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Management of MIDI IN and OUT ports
						<li>Real-time audio input and output in parallel (at the moment this feature is allowed only with MME drivers, no DirectX).
						<li>Command-line oriented real-time output (partially possible on Win95 because of some limits which are present in the operating system itself)
						<li>Hard-disk recording of a realtime session of Csound
						<li>Support of more&nbsp;file output in parallel in multichannel format, when using it in deferred time (opcode <b>fout</b>). More instances of fout can be&nbsp;used at the same time, and each instance generates an audio file of any number of channels.
					</ul>
					<p>Some of these features will be implemented also in standard version in the future (or at least I hope so).</p>
					<p>The new opcodes can be divided into <b>MIDI related</b> opcodes and <b>generic opcodes</b>.</p>
					<p>The <b>MIDI related</b> opcodes can be divided into five groups:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><i><b>MIDI CONTROLLERS</b></i> (imidic7, midic7, imidic14, midic14, imidic21, midic21, ictrl7, ctrl7, ictrl14, ctrl14, ictrl21, ctrl21, initc7, initc14, initc21, slider8, slider16, slider32, slider64, slider8f, slider16f, slider32f, slider64f, islider8, islider16, islider32, islider64, s16b14, is16b14, s32b14, is32b14)
						<li><i><b>MIDI MICRO TUNING </b></i>(release, xtratim)
						<li><i><b>MIDI GENERATORS</b></i> (ion, ioff, iondur, iondur2, moscil, kon, ioutc, koutc, ioutc14, koutc14, ioutpb, koutpb, ioutat, koutat, ioutpc, koutpc, ioutpat, koutpat, mclock, mrtmsg)
						<li><i><b>MIDI IN/OUT FLOW MANAGERS</b></i> (midiin, midiout, kon2, nrpn, mdelay)
						<li><i><b>DURATION EXTENSION OF MIDI NOTES</b></i> (xtratim, release)
					</ol>
					<p>The <b>generic opcodes</b> can be divided into 15 groups</p>
					<ol>
						<li><i><b>SUBROUTINE CALL RELATED </b></i>(icall, dicall, micall, dmicall, kargc, kargt, argc, argt, artrnc, artrnt, krtrnc, krtrnt)
						<li><i><b>WRAPPING SIGNALS AROUND</b></i> (iwrap, wrap, imirror, mirror)
						<li><i><b>INTERPOLATORS</b></i> (intrpol, kntrpol, antrpol)
						<li><i><b>PHYSICAL MODELING WAVEGUIDE BLOCKS</b></i> (physic1, physic2, flanger)
						<li><i><b>AUDIO RATE EXPONENTIAL ENVELOPES GENERATOR</b></i> (aexpseg)
						<li><i><b>MEMORY OPTIMIZED 16-BIT SOUND USAGE</b></i> (loscil2, fof3, lposcint)
						<li><i><b>PRINT K-RATE VALUES TO SCREEN</b></i> (printk2)
						<li><i><b>PRECISE OSCILLATORS</b></i> (posc, lposc)
						<li><i><b>FILTERS</b></i> (lpres, lpresx, tonex, atonex, resonx, vlpres)
						<li><i><b>FAST POWER OF TWO FUNCTIONS </b></i>(powoftwo, logbtwo)
						<li><i><b>INFORMATIONS ABOUT SOUNDIFILE FUNCTION TABLES </b></i>(iftlen2, insamp, iftsr)
						<li><i><b>NEW GEN FUNCTIONS</b></i> (GEN22, GEN23, GEN24)
						<li><i><b>TRIGGER BOOLEAN GENERATOR</b></i> (trig)
						<li><i><b>SCORE OPCODES</b></i>
						<li><i><b>SCORE MACRO OPERATORS</b></i>
					</ol>
					<p>Many of these opcodes are already ported to standard Csound by John Fitch. However, maybe some of them don't operate well in Fitch's version, because he never tested the MIDI stuff. Notice that some opcodes are renamed and/or slightly modified in standard version. This had been done mainly to prevent name pollution (for example &#145;icall&#146; family are renamed to &#145;schedule&#146;, &#145;physic1&#146; and &#145;physic2&#146; to &#145;wguide1&#146; and &#145;wguide2&#146; etc.).</p>
					<p>It is announced the new features of DirectCsound will be implemented in standard Csound too. When the porting process will be ended, I will add to my version also the opcodes names used by John Fitch.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: DirectCsound is a later version which supports Microsoft DirectX API to reduce latency in realtime performances. In RTsound only the old MME API were implemented whereas in DirectCsound both APIs are implemented. It was called RTsound until the version 1.9; after that version it is called DirectCsound. The user must choose to use DirectX (flag -+X) or MME (flag -+q and -+p) per session, but not both at the same time. The realtime audio input is currently implemented only with the MME API, so it is not possible to use DirectX when input and output are needed.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: VMCI is an acronym of Virtual Midi Control Interface. It is a set of virtual sliders, joysticks, and a virtual keyboard. It implements also a launcher for Csound, and it is designed with the idea to be a DirectCsound companion. The most important features is that all positions and configurations can be saved and restored in a later time from the hard-disk. It is very handful to control DirectCsound in realtime, but it can also be used together with other virtual or real midi instruments. In future this interface will be expanded and it will support complex interactuon of a lot of controls by moving a single slider, which is previously programmed by the user. It will also support MIDI IN, allowing an hardware MIDI device to control very complex MIDI configurations. It will be also more programmable.</td>
