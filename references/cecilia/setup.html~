We are planning on supporting other browsersbut for the time being this is the one we have chosen.<P>CECILIA uses three of the standard Csound environment variables directoriesin its operations:<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $SFDIR - where Csound writes soundfiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $SADIR - where you keep your sound analysis files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $SSDIR - where you keep your library of sounds.</PRE>For Unix, these are normally defined in your <B>.cshrc</B> file. If theseenvironment variables are not present, the directories will default toyour home directory. On Macintosh, these variables will be set to the CECILIAfolder.<BR>&nbsp;</OL>&nbsp;<HR WIDTH="100%"><OL>&nbsp;</OL></BODY></HTML>
