MIT Copyright Clarification:    

Csound is a tool for the making of music.  Just as free compilers allow you to
compile programs for commercial use, you are allowed to use Csound to make music
for commercial use. This only applies to the *sounds* produced with Csound - the
licensing agreement for the source code has not changed.  (You can use the source
code for Csound for any academic or research purpose, but you must arrange with
MIT to put it to any commercial use.) You are free to sell your friends the sounds
you make with Csound, or new instruments they can use to make their own sounds. 
If you would like to contribute your instruments to the general good of
the Csound community, the Csound list is an ideal place for this.
