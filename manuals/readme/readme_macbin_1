KNOWN BUGS/INCOMPLETE FEATURES
=======================================
Documentation and Examples:
- has not yet been brought up todate.

Perf:
- Transport is sometimes sluggish and "hangs" for 
	a moment after playback or when user hits 
	the transport then might give a slight "sputter"
- Transport sometimes acts like "floating" window even
	when in background/greyed
- RT Audio not as clean as previous versions.
- Progress/Profile feature currently disabled
- many MIDI problems
- Rescale to 24-bit AIFF might not write the proper header

Front End:
- Reset All Options/Prefs does not update open windows
- Default Dirs by button flashes when appears, and if 
	dialog is already open stays in background.
- If Direct Rendering and you start CSound,
	project window doesnt open by default.
- "Synthesizing" output file name automatically might 
	sometimes replace a filename user already typed in.
	(could make this an option..)

=======================================
NOTE TO DEVELOPERS AND USERS OF
OTHER FRONT END "LAUNCHERS"
=======================================
We have completely consolidated our sources and canonical 3.485 source. 
To do this, we had to change some of our Mac-Specific command 
line flags.  If you are a developer of a front end "launcher" 
that uses "Perf" you may have to change your application to 
accommodate.  The Mac-Specific flags are now:

-X fnam		Sound File Directory
-q fnam		Sound Sample-In Directory
-Q fnam		Analysis Directory
-V N		Number of chars in screen buffer for output window
-E N		Number of tables in graphics window
-p			Play after rendering
-e			Rescaled floats as shorts to max amplitude
-e24		Rescaled floats as 24-bit ints to max amplitude
-w			Record and Save MIDI input to a file
-y N		Enables Progress Display at rate N seconds
				or for negative N, at -N kperiods
-Y N		Enables Profile Display at rate N in seconds
				or for negative N, at -N kperiods
-- fnam		log output to file ("listing" file)
"gSound"	in command line turns off text output window

=======================================
TO DO (short term)
=======================================
- overhaul playback and RT sound out/in
- save window locations
- save user options in pref file rather
	than the application
- enable progress/profile (get code from dave)
- progress/profile on utils
- add user able to set creator of generated files
- cancel on score generation
- get perf to stop w/ cmd-period
- get perf playback play/stop with space bar?
- make score optional
- get rescale code cross-platform
- compile 68k version (almost there)
- add a "sndinfo" button next to outputfile
- have option to not show output window at all
	(only to listing)???
- have project/orc files differences transparant
	
=======================================
TO DO (long term)
=======================================
- separate windows for dispfft and display
- try to patch "dribble" output to a file to
	output in the front end instead
