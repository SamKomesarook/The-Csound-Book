here is the mac csound source.
we are currently using Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 4.

the "front end" project is a GUI interface that launches
the csound engine, "Perf" through apple events.

the "Perf" project contains two source folders:
"csound_src" is the folder that contains all the canonical
	csound source maintained by john ffitch, available from 
	the csound ftp site.  
the "Source (Mac Specific)" folder
	obviously contains source specific to the mac platform.
you will get alot of compiler warnings due to the cononical
sources: 
	we turn OFF warnings:
	====================
	possible errors, unused variables, unused arguments, implicit
	arithmetic conversions, non-inlined functions, and inconsistent
	use of 'class' and 'struct' keywords
	
**Currently, Optimiziation Level 4 breaks hetro/pvoc functions so
are compiling at Level 3 optimization.

if you make any changes/improvements/additions/to this source, we
ask you to send all files back to us so we can incorporate the
additions into the distributed source.  a bunch of different mac
versions is no fun.

feel free to email csound-dev@mills.edu for any questions, etc.
